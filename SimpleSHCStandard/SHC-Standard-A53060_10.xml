           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

              <p xml:id="A53060_10-e104210">But the speeches that Thucydides sets down, may be better credited, because most of them were premeditated, and soberly, orderly, and quietly delivered, which might more easily be noted, and exactly taken to deliver to posterity.</p>

              <p xml:id="A53060_10-e104230">Another thing is, how Tacitus could come to know the particulars and private speeches betwixt man and man, as friend and friend, brother and brother; and not only the speeches of the Roman nations, of which he might be best informed, but the speeches of persons of other nations, whose language was not easily understood, or frequent amongst the Romans; nay not only so, but he hath writ the thoughts of some commanders and others.</p>

              <p xml:id="A53060_10-e104250">Lady, you must not be so strict in history, as to have every word true: for it is a good history, if the sense, matter, manner, form, and actions be true: as for example; say a man should be presented all naked, is he less a man for being naked? or is he more a man for being clothed, or for being clothed after another fashion than his own? So a history is not the less true, if the actions, occasions, forms, and the like be related, although every word be not expressed as they were; so that Tacitus' speeches may be true, as to the sense, although he should express them after his manner, fancy, wit, or judgement. Thus the body or subject of those speeches might be true, only the dress is new.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
