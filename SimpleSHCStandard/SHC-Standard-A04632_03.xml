           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

In thee, the whole kingdom dresseth itself, and is ambitious to use thee as her glass. Beware, then, thou render men's figures truly, and teach them no less to bate their deformities, than to love their forms: for, to grace, there should come reverence; and no man can call that lovely, which is not also venerable. It is not powdering, perfuming, and every day smelling of the tailor, that converteth to a beautiful object: but a mind, shining through any suit, which needs no false light either of riches, or honours to help it. Such shalt thou find some here, even in the reign of Cynthia (A Crites, and an Arete.) Now, under thy Phoebus, it will be thy province to make more: except thou desirest to have thy source mix with the spring of self-love, and so wilt draw upon thee as welcome a discovery of thy days, as was then made of her nights.</p>

Here, is the court of Cynthia, whither he brings Cupid (Travailing on foot) resolved to turn page. By the way, Cupid meets with Mercury, (As that's a thing to be noted, take any of our playbooks without a Cupid, or a Mercury in it, and burn it for an heretic in poetry) — pray thee let me alone. Mercury, he (In the nature of a conjurer) raises up echo, who weeps over her love, or daffodil, Narcissus, a little; sings; curses the spring wherein the pretty foolish gentleman melted himself away: and there's an end of her. — now I am to inform you, that Cupid, and Mercury do both become pages. Cupid attends on Philautia, or self-love, a court-lady Mercury follows Hedon, the voluptuous, and a courtier; one that ranks himself even with Anaides, or the impudent, a gallant, (And that's my part:) one that keeps laughter, Gelaia the daughter of folly, (A wench in boys attire) to wait on him — these, in the court, meet with Amorphus, or the deformed; a traveler that hath drunk of the fountain, and there tells the wonders of the water. They presently dispatch away their pages with bottles to fetch of it, and themselves go to visit the ladies. But I should have told you — (Look, these emets put me out here) that with this Amorphus, there comes along a citizen's heir, Asotus, or the prodigal, who (In imitation of the traveller, who hath the whetstone following him) entertains the beggar, to be his attendant. — now, the nymphs who are mistresses to these gallants, are Philautia, self-love; Phantaste, a light wittiness; Argurion money; and their guardian, mother Moria; or mistress folly. —</p>

He beats a tailor very well, but a stocking-seller admirably: and so consequently any one he owes money too, that dares not resist him. He never makes general invitement, but against the publishing of a new suit, marry then, you shall have more drawn to his lodging, then come to the lanching of some three ships; especially if he be furnished with supplies for the retyring of his old wardrobe from pawn: if not, he does hire a stock of apparel, and some forty, or fifty pound in gold, for that forenoon to show. He's thought a very necessary perfume for the presence, and for that only cause welcome thither: six milliners shops afford you not the like sent. He courts ladies with how many great horse he hath rid that morning, or how oft he hath done the whole, or the half pommado in a seven-night before: and sometime venters so far upon the virtue of his pomander, that he dares tell 'em, how many shirts he has sweat at tennis that week, but wisely conceals so many dozen of balls he is on the score.

He lightly occupies the jesters room at the table, and keeps laughter Gelaia (A wench in page's attire) following him in place of a squire, whom he now and then tickles with some strange ridiculous stuff, uttered (As his land came to him) by chance. He will censure or discourse of any thing, but as absurdly as you would wish. His fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes. He never drinks below the salt. He does naturally admire his wit, that wears goldlace, or tissue. Stabs any man that speaks more contemptibly of the scholar than he. He is a great proficient in all the illiberal sciences, as cheating, drinking, swaggering, whoring, and such like: never kneels but to pledge healths; nor prays but for a pipe of pudding tobacco. He will blaspheme in his shirt. The oaths which he vomits at one supper, would maintain a town of garrison in good swearing a twelvemonth. One other genuine quality he has, which crowns all these, and that is this: to a friend in want, he will not depart with the weight of a soldered groat, lest the world might censure him prodigal, or report him a gull: marry, to his cockatrice or punquetto, half a dozen taffeta<pb facs="112" n="201"/> gowns, or satin kirtles, in a pair or two of months, why they are nothing.</p>

            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e107620">Plant yourself there, sir: and observe me. You shall now, as well be the ocular, as the earwitness, how clearly I can refel that paradox, or rather pseudodox, of those, which hold the face to be the index of the mind, which (I assure you) is not so, in any politic creature: for instance. I will now give you the particular, and distinct face of every your most noted species of persons, as your merchant, your scholar, your soldier, your lawyer, courtier, etc. and each of these so truly, as you would swear, but that your eye shall see the variation of the lineament, it were my most proper, and genuine aspect. First, for your merchant, or city-face, 'tis thus, a dull, plodding face, still looking in a direct line, forward: there is no great matter in this face. Then have you your students, or academic face, which is here, an honest, simple, and methodical face: but somewhat more spread than the former. The third is your soldier's face, a menacing, and astounding face, that looks broad, and big: the grace of this face consisteth much in a beard. The anti-face to this, is your lawyer's face, a contracted, subtle, and intricate face, full of quirks, and turnings, a labyrinthaean face, now angularly, now circularly, every way aspected. Next is your statists face, a serious, solemn, and supercilious face, full of formal, and square gravity, the eye (For the most part) deeply and artificially shadowed: there is great judgement required in the making of this face. But now, to come to your face of faces, or courtiers face, 'tis of three sorts, according to our subdivision of a courtier, elementary, practic, and theoric. Your courtier theoric, is he, that hath arrived to his farthest, and doth now know the court, rather by speculation, than practice; and this is his face: a fastidious and oblique face, that looks, as it went with a vice, and were screwed thus. Your courtier practic, is he, that is yet in his path, his course, his way, and hath not touched the puntilio, or point of his hopes; his face is here: a most promising, open,<pb facs="113" n="202"/> smooth, and overflowing face, that seems as it would run, and pour itself into you. Somewhat a northerly face. Your courtier elementary, is one but newly entered, or as it were in the alphabet, or ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la of courtship. Note well this face, for it is this you must practise.</p>

For, let your soul be assured of this (In any rank, or profession whatever) the more general, or mayor part of opinion goes with the face, and (Simply) respects nothing else. Therefore, if that can be made exactly, curiously, exquisitely, thoroughly, it is enough: but (For the present) you shall only apply yourself to this face of the elementary courtier, a light, revelling, and protesting face, now blushing, now smiling, which you may help much with a wanton wagging of your head, thus, (A feather will teach you) or with kissing your finger that hath the ruby, or playing with some string of your band, which is a most quaint kind of melancholy besides: or (If among ladies) laughing loud, and crying up your own wit, though perhaps borrowed, it is not amiss. Where is your page? call for your casting-bottle, and place your mirror in your hat, as I told you: so. Come, look not pale, observe me, set your face, and enter.</p>

'tis Asotus, the heir of Philargyrus; but first I'll give ye the others character, which may make his the clearer. He that is with him, is Amorphus, a traveler, one so made out of the mixture and shreds of forms, that himself is truly deformed. He walks most commonly with a clove, or picktooth in his mouth, he is the very mint of compliment, all his behaviours are printed, his face is another volume of essays; and his beard an Aristarchus. He speaks all cream, skimmed, and more affected than a dozen of waiting women. He is his own promoter in every place. The wife of the ordinary gives him his diet, to maintain her table in discourse, which (Indeed) is a mere tyranny over her other guests, for he will usurp all the talk: ten constables are not so tedious. He is no great shifter, once a year his apparel is ready to revolt. He doth use much to arbitrate quarrels, and fights himself, exceeding well (Out at a window.) He will<pb facs="113" n="203"/> lie cheaper than any beggar, and louder than most clocks: for which he is right properly accommodated to the whetstone, his page. The other gallant is his zany, and doth most of these tricks after him; sweats to imitate him in every thing (To a hair) except a beard, which is not yet extant. He doth learn to make strange sauces, to eat anchovies, maccaroni, bovoli, fagioli, and caviar, because he loves 'em; speaks as he speaks, looks, walks, goes so in clothes, and fashion: is in all, as if he were moulded of him. Marry (Before they met) he had other very pretty sufficiencies, which yet he retains some light impression of: as frequenting a dancing school, and grievously torturing strangers, with inquisition after his grace in his galliard. He buys a fresh acquaintance at any rate. His eye and his raiment confer much together as he goes in the street. He treads nicely, like the fellow that walks upon ropes; especially the first Sunday of his silk-stockings: and when he is most neat, and new, you shall strip him with commendations.</p>

One, in whom the humours and elements are peaceably met, without emulation of precedency: he is neither to phantasticly melancholy, too slowly phlegmatic, too lightly sanguine, or too rashly choleric, but in all, so composed and ordered, as it is clear, nature went about some full work, she did more than make a man, when she made him. His discourse is like his behaviour, uncommon, but not unpleasing; he is prodigal of neither. He strives rather to be that which men call judicious, then to be thought so: and is so truly learned, that he affects not to show it. He will think, and speak his thought, both freely: but as distant from depraving another man's merit, as proclaiming his own. For his valour, 'tis such, that he dares as little to offer an injury, as receive one. In sum, he hath a most ingenuous and sweet spirit, a sharp and seasoned wit, a straight judgement, and a strong mind. Fortune could never break him, nor make him less. He counts it his pleasure, to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good deeds, than goods. It is a competency to him that he can be virtuous. He doth neither covet nor fear; he hath too much reason to do either: and that commends all things to him.</p>

As I were a shepherdess, I would be piped and sung too; as a dairy wench, I would dance at may-poles, and make syllabubs; as a country gentlewoman, keep a good house, and come up to term, to see motions; as a citizen's wife, be troubled with a jealous husband, and put to my shifts; (Others miseries should be my pleasures) as a waiting-woman, I would taste my lady's delights to her; as a miscellany madam invent new tires, and go visit courtiers; as a great lady, lie a-bed , and have courtiers visit me; as a Duchess, I would keep my state: and as an empress, I'd do any thing. And, in all these shapes, I would ever be followed with th' affections of all that see me. Marry, I myself would affect none; or if I did, it should not be heartily, but so as I might save myself in 'em still, and take pride in tormenting the poor wretches. Or, (Now I think on't) I would, for one year, wish myself one woman, but the richest, fairest, and delicatest in a kingdom, the very centre of wealth, and beauty, wherein all lines of love should meet; and in that person I would prove all manner of suitors, of all humours, and of all complexions, and never have any two of a sort: I would see how love (By the power of his object) could work inwardly alike, in a choleric man, and a sanguine; in a melancholic, and a phlegmatic; in a fool, and a wise man; in a clown, and a courtier; in a valiant man, and a coward: and how he could vary outward, by letting this gallant express himself in dumb gaze; another with sighing, and rubbing his fingers; a third, with play-ends, and pitiful verses; a fourth, with stabbing himself, and drinking healths, or writing languishing letters in his blood; a fifth, in coloured ribbons, and good clothes; with this lord to smile, and that lord to court, and the tother lord to dote, and one lord to hang himself. And then, I to have a book made of all this, which I would call the book of humours, and every night read a little piece, ere I slept, and laugh at it. Here comes Hedon.</p>

In which time (Retiring myself into a bay-window) the beauteous lady Annabell, niece to the empress, and sister to the King of Arragon, who having never before eyed me, (But only heard the common report of my virtue, learning, and travail) fell into that extremity of passion, for my love, that she there immediately swooned: physicians were sent for, she had to her chamber, so to her bed; where (Languishing some few days) after many times calling upon me, with my name in her lips, she expired. As that (I must mourningly say) is the only fault of my fortune, that, as it hath ever been my hap to be sewed to, by all ladies, and beauties, where I have come, so, I never yet sojourned, or rested in that place, or part of the world, where some high-born admirable fair feature died not for my love.</p>

            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130410">Clear pearl of heaven, and, not to be farther ambitious in titles, Cynthia. The fame of this illustrious night, among others, hath also drawn these four fair virgins from the palace of their Queen perfection (A word ▪ which makes no sufficient difference, twixt hers, and thine) to visit thy imperial court: for she, their sovereign, not finding where to dwell among men, before her return to heaven, advised them wholly to consecrate themselves to thy celestial service, as in whose clear spirit (The proper element, and sphere of virtues) they should behold not her alone, (Their ever honoured mistress) but themselves (More truly themselves) to live enthronized. Herself would have commended them unto thy favour more particularly, but that she knows no commendation is more available with them, than that of proper virtue. Nevertheless, she willed them to present this crystal mound, a note of monarchy, and symbol of perfection, to thy more worthy deity; which, as here by me they most humbly do, so amongst the rarities thereof, that is the chief, to show whatsoever the world hath excellent, howsoever remote and various. But your irradiate judgement will soon discover the secrets of this little crystal world. Themselves (To appear more plainly) because they know nothing more odious, then false pretexts, have chosen to express<pb facs="142" n="258"/> their several qualities, thus, in several colours.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130420">The first, in citron colour, is natural affection, which given us to procure our good, is sometime called Storge, and as every one is nearest to himself, so this handmaid of reason, allowable self-love, as it is without harm, so are none without it: her place in the court of perfection was to quicken minds in the pursuit of honour. Her device is a perpendicular level, upon a cube, or square. The word, see svo modulo. Alluding to that true measure of ones self, which as every one ought to make, so is it most conspicuous in thy divine example.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130430">The second, in green, is Aglaia, delectable and pleasant conversation, whose property is to move a kindly delight, and sometime not without laughter: her office, to entertain assemblies, and keep societies together with fair familiarity. Her device within a ring of clouds, a heart with shine about it. The word, curarum Nveila pello. An allegory of Cynthia's light, which no less clears the sky, than her fair mirth the heart.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130440">The third, in the discoloured mantle spangled all over, is Euphantaste, a well conceited wittiness, and employed in honouring the court with the riches of her pure invention. Her device, upon a petasus, or mercurial hat, a crescent. The word, sic laus ingenii. Inferring, that the praise and glory of wit, doth ever increase, as doth thy growing moon.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130450">The fourth in white, is Apheleia, a nymph as pure and simple as the soul, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called simplicity, without folds, without plights, without colour, without counterfeit: and (To speak plainly) plainness itself. Her device is no device. The word under her silver shield, omnis abest fucus. Alluding to thy spotless self, who art as far from impurity, as from mortality.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e130460">Myself (Celestial goddess) more fit for the court of Cynthia, than the arbours of Cytheree, am called Anteros, or love's enemy; the more welcome therefore to thy court, and the fitter to conduct this quaternion, who as they are thy professed votaries, and for that cause adversaries to love, yet thee (Perpetual virgin) they both love, and vow to love eternally.</p>

With these four silver javelins (Which they bear in their hands) they support in princes courts the state of the presence, as by office they are obliged; which, though here they may seem superfluous, yet, for honour's sake, they thus presume to visit thee, having also been employed in the palace of Queen perfection. And though to them, that would make themselves gracious to a goddess, sacrifices were fitter than presents, or impreses, yet they both hope thy favour; and (In place of either) use several symbols, containing the titles of thy imperial dignity.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e131040">First, the hithermost, in the changeable blue, and green robe, is the commendably-fashioned gallant, Eucosmos; whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence, and delight of the surveying eye: whom ladies understand by the names of neat, and elegant. His symbol is, divae virgini, in which he would express thy deities principal glory, which hath ever been virginity. </p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e131050">The second, in the rich acoutrement, and robe of purple, impaled with gold, is Eupathes; who entertains his mind with an harmless, but not incurious variety: all the objects of his senses are sumptuous, himself a gallant, that, without excess, can make use of superfluity: go richly in embroideries, jewels (And what not?) without vanity, and fare delicately without gluttony: and therefore not (Not without cause) is universally thought to be of five humour. His symbol is, divae optimae. An attribute to express thy goodness, in which thou so resemblest Jove thy father.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e131060">The third, in the blush-coloured suit, is, Eutolmos, as duly respecting others, as never neglecting himself; commonly known by the title of good audacity : to courts, and courtly assemblies, a guest most acceptable. His symbol is, divae viragini. To express thy hardy courage, in chase of savage beasts, which harbour in woods, and wilderness.</p>
            <p xml:id="A04632_03-e131070">The fourth, in watchet tinsel, is the kind, and truly benific Eucolos. Who imparteth not without respect, but yet without difficulty; and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem double, by the<pb facs="143" n="261"/> timely, and freely bestowing thereof. He is the chief of them, who (By the vulgar) are said to be of good nature. His symbol is, divae maximae. An adjunct to signify thy greatness, which in heaven, earth, and hell is formidable.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
