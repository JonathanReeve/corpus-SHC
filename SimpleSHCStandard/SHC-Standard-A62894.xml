           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

              <p xml:id="A62894-e110330">O heavens, how have I been troubled these later<pb facs="20"/> times with women, fools, babes, tailors, poets, swaggerers, gulls, ballad-makers, they have almost disrobed me of all the toys and trifles I can devise; were it not that I pity the poor multitude of printers, these sonnet-mongers should starve for conceits, for all Phantastes. But these puling lovers, I cannot but laugh at them and their encomions of their mistresses. They make forsooth her hair of gold, her eyes of diamond, her cheeks of roses, her lips of rubies, her teeth of pearl, and her whole body of ivory: and when they have thus idoled her like Pygmalion, they fall down and worship her. Psyche, thou hast laid a hard task upon my shoulders, to invent at every ones ask, were it not that I refresh my dulness once a day with my most angelical presence, 'twere unpossible for me to undergo it.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
