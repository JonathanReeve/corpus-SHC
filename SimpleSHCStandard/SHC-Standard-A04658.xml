To make a general muster of themselves in their clothes of credit: and possess the stage, against the play. To dislike all, but mark nothing. And by their confidence of rising between the acts, in oblique lines, make affidavit to the whole house, of their not understanding one scene. Armed, with this prejudice, as the stage-furniture, or arras-cloths, they were there, as spectators,<pb facs="4"/> away. For the faces in the hangings, and they beheld alike.

        <p xml:id="A04658-e100180">He, in the mean time returning, and hearing of this departure of his lady, began, though overlate, to resent the injury he had done her: and out of his cockbrained resolution, entered into as solemn a quest of her. Since when, neither of them had been heard of. But the eldest daughter Frances, by the title of lady Frampul, enjoyed the state, her sister being lost young, and is the sole relict of the family.</p>

And hearing of a famous new-inn, that is kept by a merry host, called good-stock, in Barnet, invites some lords, and gentlemen to wait on her thither, as well to see the fashions of the place, as to make themselves merry, with the accidents on the by. It happens, there is a melancholic gentleman, one master Lovel, hath been lodged there some days before in the inn, who (Unwilling to be seen) is surprised by the lady, and invited by prudence, the lady's chambermaid, who is<pb facs="6"/> elected governess of the sports, in the inn, for that day, and installed their sovereign Lovel is persuaded by the host, and yields to the lady's invitation, which concludes the first act. having revealed his quality before, to the host. </p>

But, he failing of his word, the lady had commanded a standard of her own best apparel to be brought down: and prudence is so fitted. The lady being put in mind, that she is there alone without other company of women, borrows (By the advice of Pru) the hosts son of the house, whom they<pb facs="7"/> dress with the hosts consent, like a lady, and send out the coachman, with the empty coach, as for a kinswoman of her ladyships, mistress Laetitia silly, to bear her company: who attended with his nurse, an old charwoman in the inn, dressed oddly by the hosts council, is believed to be a lady of quality, and so received, entertained, and love made to her, by the young lord Beaufort, etc.: in the mean time, the fly of the inn is discovered to colonel glorious, with the militia of the house, below the stairs, in the drawer, tapster, chamberlain, and ostler, inferior officers, with the coachman Trundle, ferret, etc. And, the preparation is made, to the lady's design upon Lovel, his upon her, and the sovereigns upon both.</p>

          <p xml:id="A04658-e100240">Lovel, by the dexterity, and wit of the sovereign of the sports, prudence; having two hours assigned him, of free colloquy, and love-making to his mistress, one, after dinner, the other after supper; the court being set, is demanded by the lady Frampul, what love is? as doubting if there were any such power, or no. To whom, he first by definition, and after by argument answers, proving, and describing the effects. of love, so vively, as she, who had derided the name of love before, hearing his discourse, is now so taken both with the man, and his matter, as she confesseth herself enamoured of him, and, but for the ambition she hath to enjoy the other hour, had presently<pb facs="8"/> declared herself: which gives both him, and the spectator's occasion to think she yet dissembles, notwithstanding the payment of her kiss, which he celebrates. And the court dissolves, upon a news brought, of a new lady, a newer coach, and a new coachman called Barnaby. </p>

They are both condemned, and censured, she stripped like a doxy, and sent home a foot. In the interim, the second hour goes on, and the question, at suit of the lady Frampul, is changed from love to valour; which ended, he receives his second kiss, and by the rigor of the sovereign, falls into a fit of melancholy, worse, or more desperate than the first.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04658-e100270">The fifth, and last act is the catastrophe, or knitting up of all, where fly<pb facs="9"/> brings word to the host, of the lord Beaufort's being married privately in the new stable, to the supposed lady, his son; which the host receives as an omen of mirth. But complains, that Lovel is gone to bed melancholic, when prudence appears dressed in the new suit applauded by her lady, and employed to retrieve Lovel. The host encounters them, with this relation of l. Beaufort's marriage, which is seconded by the l. Latimer, and all the servants of the house. In this while, l. Beaufort comes in, and professes it, calls for his bed, and bride-bowl, to be made ready, the host forbids both, shows whom he hath married, and discovers him to be his son, a boy. The lord bridegroom confounded, the nurse enters like a frantic bed lem, cries out on fly, says she is undone, in her daughter, who is confessed to<pb facs="9"/> be the lord Frampul's child, sister to the other lady, the host to be their father. She his wife. He finding his children, bestows them one on Lovel, the other on the lord Beaufort, the inn upon fly, who had been a Gipsy with him, offers a portion with prudence, for her wit, which is refused; and she taken, by the lord Latimer, to wife; for the crown of her virtue, and goodness. And all are contented.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
