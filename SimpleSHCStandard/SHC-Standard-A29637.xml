           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A29637-e100140">I have, long since, studied in these anti-ingenious times, to find out a man, that might, at once, be both a judge and patron to this issue of my old age, which needs both. And my blessed stars have flung me upon you: in whom both those attributes concentre and flourish: nor can I yet find a reason, why I should present it to you (It being below your acceptance or censure) but only my own confidence; which had not grown to this forwardness, had it not been encouraged by your goodness. Yet we all know, beggars use to flock to great men's gates. And, though my fortune has cast me in that mould, I am poor and proud; and preserve the humour of him, who could not beg for any thing, but great boons, such, as are your kind acceptance and protection. I dare not say (As my brothers use) that I present this, as a testimonial of my gratitude or recompense for your favours: for (I protest) I conceive it so far from quitting old engagements, that it creates new. So that, all, that this play can do, is but to make more work; and involves me in debts, beyond a possibility of satisfaction. Sir, it were a folly in me, to tell you of your worth, the world knows it enough; and are bold to say, fortune and nature scarce ever clubbed so well. You know, sir, I am old, and cannot cringe, nor court, with the powdered<pb facs="3"/> and ribbanded wits of our days: but, though I cannot speak so much, I can think as well, and as honourably as the best. All the arguments I can use to induce you to take notice of this thing of nothing, is, that it had the luck to tumble last of all in the epidemical ruin of the scene; and now limps hither with a wooden leg, to beg an alms at your hands. I will wind up all, with a use of exhortation, that since the times conspire to make us all beggars, let us make ourselves merry; which (If I am not mistaken) this drives at. Be pleased therefore, sir, to lodge these harmless beggars in the outhouses of your thoughts; and, among the rest, him, that in this cuckoo time, puts in for a membership, and will fill the choir of those, that duly and truly pray for you, and is,</p>

I passed by 'em in haste, but something so possesses me, that I must — what the devil must I? A beggar? Why, beggars are flesh and blood; and rags are no diseases. Their lice are no French fleas. And there is much wholesomer flesh under country dirt, than city painting: and less danger in dirt and rags, than in ceruse and satin. I durst not take a touch at London, both for the present cost, and fear of an after-reckoning. But Oliver, dost thou speak like a gentleman? fear price or pox, ha? Marry do I sir: nor can beggar-sport be inexcusable in a young country gentleman, short of means, for another respect, a principal one indeed; to avoid the<pb facs="33"/> punishment or charge of bastardy: there's no commuting with them; or keeping of children for them. The poor whores, rather than part with their own, or want children at all, will steal other folks, to travel with, and move compassion. He feeds a beggar-wench well that fills her belly with young bones. And these reasons considered, good master Oliver — 'slid yonder they are at peep. And now sitten down as waiting for my purpose. <stage xml:id="A29637-e118240">Ent. Vinc.</stage>heart here's another delay. I must shift him. Dost hear honest poor fellow?

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
