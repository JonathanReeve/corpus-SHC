           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Lose no time bloods, lose no time; though the sun go to bed never so much before you, yet be you up before him; call the golden sluggard from the silver arms of his lady, to light you into yours, when your old father January here in one of his last days, thrusts his forehead into the depth of May's fragrant bosom: what may you Aprilles perform then? O what may you do? Well yet will I say thus much for myself, wheresoever the affections of youth are, there must needs be the instruments, and where the instruments are, there must of necessity be the faculties; what am I short of them then? A sound old man, ably constituted, wholesomely dieted, that took his may<pb facs="3" n="4"/> temperately at their ages, and continued his own; why should he not continue their ages in his own? By the mass I feel nothing that stands against it, and therefore sweet may I salute thee with the youngest: I have love to employ thee in, as well as the proudest young princock, and so have at you mistress Frances China: have at you mistress Frank: I'll spread my nets for you i'faith, though they be my very purse nets, wherein what heart will not willingly lie panting? <stage xml:id="A18415-e100160">(Enter Angelo.)</stage></p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
