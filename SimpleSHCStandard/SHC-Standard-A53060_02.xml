           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Besides, much variety of company, creates amorous luxury, vanity, prodigality, jealousy, envy, malice, slander, envy, treachery, quarrels, revenge and many other evils, as laying plots to ensnare the honourable, to accuse the innocent, to deceive the honest, to corrupt the chaste, to deboyst the temperate, to pick the purse of the rich, to enslave the poor, to pull down lawful authority, and to break just laws; but when a man lives to himself within his own family, and without recourse, after a solitary manner, he lives free, without control, not troubled with company, but entertains himself with himself, which makes the soul wise, the mind sober, the thoughts industrious, the understanding learned, the heart honest, the senses quiet, the appetites temperate, the body healthful, the actions just and prudent, the behaviour civil and sober; he governs orderly, eats peaceably, sleeps quietly, lives contentedly, and most commonly, plentifully and pleasantly, ruling and governing<pb facs="41" n="56"/> his little family to his own humour, wherein he commands with love, and is obeyed with duty, and who that is wise, and is not mad; would quit this heavenly life to live in hellish societies, and what can an honest husband and wife desire more, than love, peace and plenty, and when they have this, and is not content, 'tis a sign they stand upon a quagmire, or rotten foundation, that will never hold or endure, that is, they are neither grounded on honesty, nor supported with honour.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
