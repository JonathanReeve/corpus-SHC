           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A03202-e100090">To you (As whom this play most especially concerns) I thought good to dedicate this labour, which though written many years since, in my infancy of judgement in this kind of poetry, and my first practice: yet understanding (By what means I know not) it was in these more exquisite and refined times to come to the press, in such a forwardness ere it came to my knowledge, that it was passed prevention, and knowing withal, that it comes short of that accurateness both in plot and style, that these more censorious days with greater curiosity acquire, I must<pb facs="3"/> thus excuse. That as plays were then some fifteen or sixteen years ago it was in the fashion. Nor could it have found a more seasonable and fit publication then at this time, when, to the glory of our nation, the security of the kingdom, and the honour of the city, they have begun again the commendable practice of long forgotten arms, the continuance of which I wish, the discipline approve, and the encouragement thereof even with my soul applaud. In which great and hoped good they deserve not the least attribute of approbation: who, in the dull and sleepy time of peace, first wakened the remembrance of these arms in the artillery garden, which begun out of their voluntary affections, prosecuted by their private industries, and continued at their own proper cost and charge, deserves in my opinion, not only respect and regard, but recompense<pb facs="3"/> and reward. But to return again to you, my brave spirited prentices, upon whom I have freely bestowed these four I I wish you all, that have their courages and forwardness, their noble fates and fortunes,</p>

Do you not see this long black velvet cloak upon my back? Have you not sounded thrice? Do I not look pale, as fearing to be out in my speech ? nay, have I not all the signs of a prologue about me? Then, to what end come you to interrupt me?</p>
        <p n="2" xml:id="A03202-e100420">2 I have a prologue to speak too.</p>
        <p n="3" xml:id="A03202-e100430">3 and I another.</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100440">1 oh superfluous, and more than ever I heard of! three prologues to one play!</p>
        <p n="2" xml:id="A03202-e100450">2 have you not seen three ropes to toll one bell, three doors to one house, three ways to one town?</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100460">1 I grant you: but I never heard of any that had three heads to one body, but Cerberus. But what doth your prologue mean?</p>
        <p n="2" xml:id="A03202-e100470">2 I come to excuse the name of the play?</p>
        <p n="3" xml:id="A03202-e100480">3 I the errors in the play.</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100490">1 and I the author that made the play. Touching the name, why is it called, true and strange, or the four prentices of London? A gentleman that heard the subject discoursed, said it was not possible to be true; and none here are bound to believe it.</p>
        <p n="2" xml:id="A03202-e100500">2 'tis true, that Alexander at thirty years of age conquered the whole world; but strange he should do so. If we should not believe things recorded in former ages, we were<pb facs="5"/> not worthy that succeeding times should believe things done in these our ages.</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100510">1 but what authority have you for your history? I am one of those that will believe nothing that is not in the chronicle.</p>
        <p n="2" xml:id="A03202-e100520">2 our authority is a manuscript, a book writ in parchment; which not being public, nor general in the world, we rather thought fit to exemplify to the public censure, things concealed and obscured, such as are not common with every one, than such historical tales as every one can tell by the fire in winter. Had not ye rather, for novelties sake, see Jerusalem ye never saw, than London that ye see hourly? So much touching the name of our history.</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100530">1 you have satisfied me; and, I hope, all that hear me. Now what have you to speak concerning the errors in the play?</p>
        <p n="3" xml:id="A03202-e100540">3 we acknowledge none: for the errors we could find, we would willingly amend; but if these clear-sighted gentlemen, with the eyes of their judgements, looking exactly into us, find any imperfections which are hid from ourselves, our request is, you would rather look over them, then through them, not with a troubled eye, that makes one object to seem two, but with a favourable eye, which hath power in itself to make many to seem none at all.</p>
        <p n="1" xml:id="A03202-e100550">1 o now I understand you. Three prologues to our play, pardon me, you've need of three hundred, methinks , and all little enough. But to end our beginning in a word. Thus much by the patience of these gentlemen.</p>
        <p xml:id="A03202-e100560">Spectators, should you oppose your judgements against us: where we are three, which some would think too many; were we three thousand, we think ourselves to few. Our author submits his labours to you, as the authors of all the content he hath within this circumference.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
