           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Hail King, and Queen of the islands, called truly fortunate, and by you made so; to tell you, who I am, and wear all these notable, and speaking ensigns about me, were to challenge you of most impossible ignorance, and accuse myself of as palpable glory: it is enough that you know me here, and come with the licence of my father Jove, who is the bounty of heaven, to give you early welcome to the bower of my mother Maia, no less the goodness of earth. And may it please you to walk, I will tell you no wonderful story. This place, whereon you are now advanced (By the mighty power of poetry, and the help of a faith, that can remove mountains) is the Arcadian hill Cyllene, the place, where myself was both begotten, and born; and of which I am frequently called Cyllenius: under yond purslane tree stood sometime my cradle. Where, now, behold my mother Maia, sitting in the pride of her plenty, gladding the air with her breath, and cheering the spring with her smiles. At her feet, the blushing Aurora, who, with her rosy hand, casteth her honey dews on those sweeter herbs, accompanied with that gentle wind, Favonius, whose subtle spirit, in the breathing forth, Flora makes into flowers, and sticks them in the grass, as if she contended to have the embroidery of the<pb facs="467" n="881"/> earth, richer than the cope of the sky. Here, for her month, the yearly delicate may keeps state; and from this mount, takes pleasure to display these valleys, yond lesser hills, those statelier edifices, and towers, that seem enamoured so far off, and are reared on end, to behold her, as if their utmost object were her beauties. Hither the dryads of the valley, and nymphs of the great river come every morning, to taste of her favours; and depart away with laps filled with her bounties. But, see! upon your approach their pleasures are instantly remitted. The birds are hushed, Zephyre is still, the morn forbears her office, Flora is dumb, and herself amazed, to behold two such marvels, that do more adorn place, than she can time; pardon, your majesty, the fault, for it is that hath caused it; and till they can collect their spirits, think silence, and wonder the best adoration.</p>

May all the blessings both of earth, and heaven, concur to thank you: for till this day's sun, I have faintly enjoyed a minute's rest to my creation. Now, I do, and acknowledge it you sole, and no less the divine benefit. If my desire to delight you, might not divert to your trouble, I would entreat your eyes to a new, and strange spectacle; a certain son of mine, whom the Arcadians call a god, howsoever the rest of the world receive him: it is the horned pan, whom in the translated figure of a goat I begotten on the fair Spartan Penelope; may, let both your ears, and looks forgive it: these are but the lightest escapes of our deities. And, it is better in me, to prevent his rustic impudence, by my blushing acknowledgement, then, anon, by his rude, and not insolent claim, be enforced to confess him. Yonder he keeps, and with him the wood nymphs, whose leader he is in rounds, and dances, to this sylvan music. The place, about which they skip, is the fount of laughter, or Bacchus spring; whose statue is advanced on the top; and from whose pipes, at an observed hour of the day, there flows a lusty liquor, that hath the present virtue to expel sadness; and within certain minutes after it is tasted, force all the mirth of the spleen into the face. Of this is pan the guardian. Lo! the fountain begins to run, but the nymphs at your sight are fled. Pan, and his satires wildly stand at gaze. I will approach, and question him: vouchsafe your ear, and forgive his behaviour, which (Even to me, that am his parent) will no doubt be rude enough, though otherwise full of salt, which, except my presence did temper, might turn to be gall, and bitterness; but that shall charm him.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
