           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

But my friends should have preferred discipline before affection: for they know of my folly, yea my own husband knew of my breach of disloyalty, and yet suffered me, by reason he<pb facs="16"/> knew it bootless to kick against the prick. Ah sweet King Edward, little didst thou think Shore's wife should have been so hardly used, thy unnatural brother not content with my goods which are yet confiscate in his custody, but yet more to add to my present misery, hath proclaimed upon great penalty, that none whatsoever, shall either aid or succour me, but here being comfortless to die in the streets with hunger. I am constrained to beg, but I fear 'tis in vain, for none will pity me. Yet here comes one to whom I have done good, in restoring his lands that were lost, now will I try him to see if he will give me anything.</p>

How many headless peers sleep in their graves, whose places are furnish with their inferiors? Such as are neither nobly born, nor virtuously minded. My heart hardly bewails the loss of the young King, by the outrage of the protector, who hath proclaimed himself King, by the name of Richard the third. The commons murmur at it greatly, that the young King and his brother should be imprisoned, but to what end 'tis hard to say, but many think they shall never come forth again.

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
