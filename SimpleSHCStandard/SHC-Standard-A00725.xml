           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

And now I look up, and find to whom my dedication is, I fear I am as good as my determination: notwithstanding I leave a liberty to any lady or woman, that dares say she hath been no weathercock, to assume the title of patroness to this my book. If she have been constant, and be so, all I will expect from her for my pains, is, that she will continue so, but till my next play be printed, wherein she shall see what amends I have made to her, and all the sex, and so I end my epistle, without a Latin sentence.</p>

I send a comedy to you here, as good as I could then make; nor sleight my presentation, because it is a play: for I tell thee reader, if thou beest ignorant, a play is not so idle a thing as thou art, but a mirror of men's lives and actions now, be it perfect or imperfect, true or false, is the vice or virtue of the maker. This is yet, as well, as I can, qualeis ego vel clwienus, thou must needs have some other language than thy mother rung, for thou thinkst it impossible for me to write a play that did not use a word of Latin, though he had enough in him. I have been vexed with vile plays myself, a great while, hearing many, now I thought to be even with some, and they should hear mine too. Fare thee well, if thou hast any thing to say to me, thou knowest where to hear of me for a year or two, and no more I assure thee.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
