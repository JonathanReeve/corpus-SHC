           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A12074-e100270">Sir, I must needs discharge two epistles upon you the one the readers, that should be like hail shot ▪ that scatters and strikes a multitude, the other dedicatory, like a bullet, that aims only at yourself: if either do strike you, it shall be at your choice, whether I shall hit you in the head, to let you understand my meaning, or in the heart, to make you conceive my love: yet I must confess, I had rather express my love out of the flint, than my meaning in any part of the shot. I aim at you rather than the reader, because since our travails I have been pregnant with desire to bring forth something whereunto you may be witness, and now being brought a-bed if you please to be godfather, I doubt not but this child shall be well maintained, seeing he cannot live above an hour with you, and therefore shall entreat you, when he is dead, he may be buried deep enough in your good opinion, and he shall deserve this epitaph:</p>
        <p xml:id="A12074-e100280">Here lies the child, who was born in mirth, against the strict rules of all childbirth: and to be quit, I gave him to my friend, who laughed him to death, and that was his end.</p>

        <l xml:id="A12074-e100330">Our author's pen, loves not to swim in blood,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100340">He dips no ink, from out black Acheron:</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100350">Nor sucks invention, from the depth of hell,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100360">Nor crosseth seas to get a foreign plot. </l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100370">He taxes no goddesses for foulest lust,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100380">Nor doth disclose the secret scapes of Jove:</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100390">He rips not up the horrid maw of hell,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100400">To show foul treasons hideous ugly face. </l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100410">Nor doth he touch the falls of mighty Kings,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100420">No ancient history, no shepherd's love. </l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100430">No statesman's life, no power of death he shows. </l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100440">He only strives with mirth to please each one,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100450">Since laughter is peculiar unto man.</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100460">And being sure, freely to speak can be no sin,</l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100470">If honest words have honest construing. </l>
        <l xml:id="A12074-e100480">Therefore to fly the least cause of offence,</l>

Lust, it's like an over-swollen river, that breaks beyond all bounds: it's a devil bred in the blood, nursed in desire, and like a salamader lives in a continual fire: it sprouteth larger than the ivy, which embraceth, twisteth and entangleth every one within his reach, and makes no choice betwixt the goodliest cedar and the stinkingst elder: it's a foul usurper on the name of love, and reigns with greater domination then an emperor: it's a very leprous itch, it stains, and leaves a fouler spot upon the soul than tears can wash away: but my chaste thoughts shall watch mine honour: I'll muster up my prayers to fight against temptation: shall I that have been a commander of myself, now prove a slave to sin? No, no, my mounting thoughts do soar too high a pitch to stoop to any stranger's lure. Say that a peevish fly entangled were within my never-shorn tresses, should I to save his life, cut and deform me of so rich an ornament? What though the lord Nonsuch within my love entangled be, must my honour now be clipped to set him free? No, no, my saw is this and ever shall: he that on hope doth climb doth often fall. But what shall I do? 'a writes here a will come: wit of a woman now assist me, oh apron strings be now auspicious, for here's my husband, something I must do: I have't.</p>

Or why do your sempsters spend their time in pricking, and your ladies in poking of ruffs; but only to show they do as they would be done unto? or why do your inns of court men lie with his laundress in a long vacation, but because he hath no money to go abroad? Or why do your old judges widows<pb facs="23"/> always marry young gentlemen, but to show that they love execution better than judgement.</p>

              <p xml:id="A12074-e110940">Foe: she knew you were but a prentice to the occupation, and commonly prentices spoil their first work, and being unskilful, she was loath you should practise in a good shop, and therefore she befriended you, because she would have it well done: she got a better workman to do it for you. For what's the reason the younger brothers (According to the old wife's tails) always proved the wisest men, but because the fathers grew more skilful at last than they were at the first? but I think your wife's eldest son will prove an excellent fellow, because she had the help of so many in the making of it. For commonly if one have a thing to be done, as a conveyance to be drawn, or a case in the law to be argued, a man would have the help of as many good lawyers as he could get: now this case of making of children, and a case in the law, is something like, for as one lawyer takes his fee, and deals in't, another lawyer comes and argues the case more profoundly: but in the end when all is done, leaves it to be tried by the jury, in whom the right is, and so must you: when they and you and all have done your best, yet in the end, must leave it to be tried by your wife, who's the child is, for a woman's knowledge in this case, is better than twelve men's.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
