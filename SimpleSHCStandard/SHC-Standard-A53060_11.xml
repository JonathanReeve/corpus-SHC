           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

          <l xml:id="A53060_11-e100310">Opinions easily do pass upon</l>
          <l xml:id="A53060_11-e100320">The wit of others, though themselves have none;</l>
          <l xml:id="A53060_11-e100330">And envy rounds the sense, and words about,</l>
          <l xml:id="A53060_11-e100340">Hoping some errors it may soon find out. </l>
          <l xml:id="A53060_11-e100350">But streams of wit do not so often flow,</l>

'tis true, should I marry, I should prefer my husband's honour before his life, yet would I not willingly marry a man, whose life shall be set at the stake, and fortune still throwing at it, for that would make me live miserably: and who would wilfully make themselves miserable, when nature forbids it, and God commands it not?</p>

But certainly she must needs have a wise wit: for she seems melancholy and contemplative, which no fool is; she hears much, and speaks little, which no fool doth: wherefore I judge she hath wit, but either she is careless, and cares not to express it, or thinks the company fools, and therefore will not express it, or is so bashful, as she cannot express it; and there is nothing shows, or discovers wit so much as bashfulness, which shows the mind and thoughts so sensible, as they apprehend beyond another's perceivance, and so fearful lest they should commit errors in their actions and expressions, as they obscure their virtues and natural excellencies, for want of a confident assurance, and a good opinion of their own abilities; besides, bashfulness thinks the least natural defect<pb facs="204" n="385"/> a crime, and every little error a disgrace, never to be rubbed out; they will blush at their own thoughts, and will pine almost into a consumption, if two or three idle words should slip out of their mouths, or that they should mistake an argument, or that their behaviour was not so or so: the truth is, they never think their actions or their words well enough done or spoken; they are the first that shall condemn themselves, and the last that shall give themselves a pardon: but prithee Ned, as thou art my friend, see if you can procure me, or watch for an opportunity, that I might speak with her alone.</p>

But now we begin to cast shadows of dissimulation, which shows our love is in an eclipse, and from a pretence of the confidence and assurance we have of each other, we begin to be careless of each others discourse or action, giving ourselves freedom and liberty to wander, not only from our home-affairs, but from our professed affections, to seek for pleasures and delights abroad, and only a seeming affection and delight remains at home: and thus by a juggling deceit, and false-glaced love, we shall in the discovery become enemies, and by a seeming wisdom, we shall become fools, and our follies, as well as our crimes, will destroy the unity of love, and the peace of matrimonial government; and though we should not break out into open war, yet we shall live factious, and our servants will be as commoners, siding with each party: but it seems your mistress hath learned your mind so perfectly, and knows your humour so exactly, and can match your appetites with pleasure so justly, as she hath worked out her designs skilfully, which is, to displace me, and to place herself in your affections, by which she can make a subtle advantage of your estate and fortune, I mean good fortune: for in bad fortune she may chance; nay, 'tis most likely she will desert you for those that will and do forsake virtue, chastity, and honour, are not likely to stick to misfortunes, as to follow banishment, or to live with poverty, to bear injury, to endure scorn, and to die in misery. True love may do it; but for those affections that are produced by incontinency, and not bound to honesty, and settled by constancy, will change more often than the wind, wavering from person to person.</p>

I cannot say my estate or birth deserves you, nor have I merits equal to your worth; but since my love is as pure as your virtue, it will be an equal match: and though you see my body a deformed bulk, yet I am not ashamed of it, because the owner, which<pb facs="209" n="394"/> is my mind, is honest: for I never betrayed my King, or country, mistress, or friend, nor any trust that was imposed unto me by any, although a foe; I never shut my purse, nor sheathed my sword from helping the distressed, nor turned my back upon my assaulting enemy; I never stole good fame, nor robbed good names, nor stabbed innocency with slander; I never scorned those below myself, nor envied those above me; I never infringed the laws of honour, nor disturbed civil society; and though I cannot suffer an injury patiently, yet I never did omit a duty willingly: as for the truth of what I say, I have none to witness for me, as being a stranger, but my own words, from which this company (Perchance) may think self-love and great desire hath bribed my tongue; but if they do, their thoughts make truth no less, no more than eyes that are blind, ears that are deaf, can rob you of your wit and beauty: for though your wit they do not hear, nor beauty see, yet you possess them no less, their want only robs you of their admiration, not of the possession; and say I am blind of one eye, my other eye doth see, and I have hearing perfectly, which doth inform my knowledge and understanding, with that which makes my admirations and adorations perfect and sound within my heart, wherein your picture is printed on, which my soul doth view, and gazing, kneels with wonder and astonishment, that so much wit, wisdom, and virtue should be in one so young and fair: and if you cannot love me, despise me not; for my pure love is divine, as being divinely placed on you; and it would grieve my soul, to have the zealous fire and immaculate flame of my affection extinguished with your neglecting thoughts, and raked up in the ashes of your forgetfulness: but if any of my sex shall seem to jest, or scorn me for my outward form or shape,</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
