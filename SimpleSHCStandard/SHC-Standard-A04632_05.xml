           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A04632_05-e100190">Aelius Sejanus, son to Seius Strabo, a gentleman of Rome, and born at vulsinium, after his long service in court: first, under Augustus, afterwards, Tiberius: grew into that favour with the latter, and won him by those arts, as there wanted nothing, but the name, to make him a copartner of the empire. Which greatness of his, Drusus, the emperor's son not brooking, after many smothered dislikes, it one day breaking out, the prince struck him publicly on the face. To revenge which disgrace, Livia, the wife of Drusus (Being before corrupted by him to her dishonour, and the discovery of her husband's counsels) Sejanus practiseth with, together with her physician, called Eudemus, and one, an eunuch, to poison Drusus. This their inhumane act having successful, and unsuspected passage, it emboldeneth Sejanus to farther, and more insolent projects, even the ambition of the empire: where finding the lets, he must encounter, to be many, and hard, in respect of the issue of Germanicus (Who were next in hope for the succession) he deviseth to make Tiberius' self, his means: and instills into his ears many doubts, and suspicions, both against the princes, and their mother Agrippina: which Caesar jealously harkening to, as covetously consenteth to their ruin, and their friends. In this time, the better to mature and strengthen his design, he labours to marry Livia, and worketh (With all his engine) to remove Tiberius from the knowledge of public business, with allurements of a quiet and retired life: the latter of which, Tiberius (Out of a proneness to lust, and a desire to hide those unnatural pleasures, which he could not so publicly practise) embraceth: the former enkindleth his fears, and there gives him first cause of doubt, or suspect towards Sejanus. Against whom, he raiseth (In private) a new instrument, one Sertorius Macro, and by him underworketh, discovers the others counsels, his means, his ends, sounds the affections of the senators, divides, distracts them: at last, when Sejanus least looketh, and is most secure (With pretext of doing him an unwonted honour in the senate) he trains him from his guards, with one letter, and in one day, hath him suspected, accused, condemned, and torn in pieces, by the rage of the people,</p>

The care of the commonwealth, howsoever we are removed in person, cannot be absent to our thought; although, oftentimes, even to princes most present, the truth of their own affairs is hid: than which, nothing falls out more miserable to a state, or makes the art of governing more difficult. But since it hath been our easeful happiness to enjoy both the aides, and industry of so vigilant a senate, we profess to have been the more indulgent to our pleasures, not as being careless of our office, but rather secure of the necessity. Neither do these common rumours of many, and infamous libels, published against our retirement, at all afflict us; being born more out of men's ignorance, than their malice: and will, neglected, find their own grave quickly; whereas too sensibly acknowledged, it would make their obloquy ours. Nor do we desire their authors (Though found) be censured, since in a free state (As ours) all men ought to enjoy both their minds, and tongues free.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
