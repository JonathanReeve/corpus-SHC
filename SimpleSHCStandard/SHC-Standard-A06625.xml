           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A06625-e100080">Where the bee can suck no honey, she leaveth her sting behind, and where the bear cannot find origanum to heal his grief, he blasteth all other leaves with his breath. We fear it is like to fare so with us, that seeing you cannot draw from our labours sweet content, you leave behind you a sour mislike, and with open reproach blame our good meanings: because you cannot reap your wonted mirths. Our intent was at this time to move inward delight, not outward lightness, and to breed, (If it might be) soft smiling, not loud laughing: knowing it to the wise to be as great pleasure to hear counsel mixed with wit, as to the foolish to have sport mingled with rudeness. They were banished the theater at Athens, and from Rome hissed, that brought parasites on the stage with apish actions, or fools with uncivil habits, or courtesans with immodest words. We have endeavoured to be as far from unseemly speeches, to make your ears glow, as we hope you will be from unkind reports to make our cheeks blush. The griffyon never spreadeth her wings in the sun, when she hath any sick feathers: yet have we ventured to present out exercise before your judgements, when we know them full of weak matter, yielding rather ourselves to the courtesy, which we have ever sound, then to the preciseness, which we ought to fear.</p>

        <head>The prologue at the court.</head>
        <p xml:id="A06625-e100100">The Arabians being stuffed with perfumes, burn hemlock, a rank poison: and in Hybla being cloyed with honey, they account it dainty to feed on wax. Your highness' eyes, whom variety hath filled with fair shows, and whose ears pleasure hath possessed with rare sounds, will (We trust) at this time resemble the princely eagle, who fearing to surfeit on spices, stoopeth to bite on wormwood. We present no conceits nor wars, but deceits and loves, wherein the truth may excuse the plainness. The necessity, the length: the poetry, the bitterness. There is no needless point so small, which hath not his compass: nor hair so slender, which hath not his shadow: nor sport so simple, which hath not his shadow: nor sport so simple, which hath not show. Whatsoever we present, whether it be tedious (Which we fear) or toyish (Which we doubt) sweet or sour, absolute or imperfect, or whatsoever, in all humbleness we all, and I on knee for all, entreat, that your highness imagine yourself to be in a deep dream, that staying the conclusion, in your rising your majesty vouchsafe but to say, and so you awaked. </p>

            <p xml:id="A06625-e100160">Thou art a ferryman, Phao, yet a free man, possessing for riches content, and for honour's quiet. Thy thoughts are no higher than thy fortunes, nor thy desires greater than thy calling. Who climbeth, standeth on glass, and falleth on thorn. Thy heart's thirst is satisfied with thy hands thrift, and thy gentle labours in the day, turn to sweet slumbers in the night. As much doth it delight thee to rule thine oar in a calm stream, as it doth Sapho to sway the sceptre in her brave court. Envy never casteth her eye low, ambition pointeth always upward, and revenge barketh only at stars. Thou farest dilicately, if thou have a fare to buy any thing. Thine angle is ready, when thine oar is idle, and as sweet is the fish which thou gettest in the river, as the fowl which other buy in the market. Thou needst not fear poison in thy glass, nor treason in thy guard. The wind is thy greatest enemy, whose might is withstood with policy. O sweet life seldom found under a golden covert, often under a thached cottage. But here cometh one, I will withdraw myself aside, it may be a passenger.</p>

            <p xml:id="A06625-e100180">It is no less unseemly than unwholesome for Venus, who is most honoured in prince's courts, to sojourn with Vulcan in a smith's forge, where bellows blow in steed of sighs, dark smokes rise for sweet perfumes, and for the panting of loving hearts, is only heard the beating of steeled hammers. Unhappy Venus, that carrying fire in thine own breast, thou shouldst dwell with fire in<pb facs="4"/> his forge. What doth Vulcan all day but endeavour to be as crabbed in manners, as he is crooked in body? driving nails, when he should give kisses, and hammering hard armours, when he should sing sweet amours. It came by lot, not love, that I was linked with him. He gives thee bolts, Cupid, instead of arrows, fearing belike (Jealous fool that he is) that if he should give thee an arrow head he should make himself a broad head. But come, we will to Syracusa, where thy deity shall be shown, and my disdain. I will yoke the neck, that yet never bowed, at which, if Jove repine, Jove shall repent. Sapho shall know, be she never so fair, that there is a Venus, which can conquer, were she never so fortunate.</p>

Besides, do you not look on fair ladies in steed of good letters, and behold fair faces instead of fine phrases: in universities virtues and vices are but shadowed in colours white and black, in courts showed to life good and bad. There, times past are read of in old books, times present set down by new devises, times to come conjectured at by aim, by prophesy, or chance here, are times in perfection, nor by device, as fables, but in execution, as truths. Believe me Pandion, in Athens you have but tombs, we in court the bodies, you the pictures of Venus and the wise goddesses, we the persons and the virtues. What hath a scholar found out by study, that a courtier hath not found out by practice. Simple are you that think to see more at the candle snuff, than the sun beams, to sail further in a little brook, then in the main ocean, to make a greater harvest by gleaning, then reaping. How say you Pandion, is not all this true?</p>

Thou dost not flatter thyself Phao, thou art fair: fair? I fear me fair, be a word too foul for a face so passing fair. But what availeth beauty, hadst thou all things thou wouldst wish, thou mightst die tomorrow, and didst thou want all things thou desirest, thou shalt live till thou diest. Tush Phao, there is grown more pride in thy mind, than favour in thy face. Blush foolish boy, to think on thine own thoughts: cease complaints, and crave counsel. And lo, behold Sibylla in the mouth of her cave, I will salute her. Lady, I fear me I am out of my way, and so benighted withal that I am compelled to ask your direction.</p>

He to sweet prayers<pb facs="8"/> added great promises, I either desirous to make trial of his power, or willing to prolong mine own life, caught up my handful of sand, consenting to his suit, if I might live as many years as there were grains.

I did as you do, go with my glass, ravished with the pride of mine own beauty, and you shall do as I do, loath to see a glass disdaining deformity. There was none that heard of my fault, but shunned my favour, insomuch as I stooped for age before I tasted of youth, sure to be long lived, uncertain to be beloved. Gentlemen that used to sigh from their hearts for my sweet love, began to point with their fingers at my withered face, and laughed to see the eyes, out of which fire seemed to sparkle, to be suckered being old with spectacles. This causeth me to withdraw myself to a solitary cave, where I must lead six hundred years in no less pensiveness of crabbed age, than grief of remembered youth. Only this comfort, that being ceased to be fair, I study to be wise, wishing to be thought a grave matron, since I cannot return to be a young maid.</p>

When you shall behold over this tender flesh a tough skin, your eyes which were wont to glance on others faces to be sunk so hollow, that you can scarce look out of your own head, and when all your teeth shall wag as fast as your tongue, then will you repent the time which you cannot recall, and be enforced to bear what most you blame. Lose not the pleasant time of your youth, than the which there is nothing swifter, nothing sweeter. Beauty is a slippery good, which decreaseth whilst it is increasing, resembling the meddler, which in the moment of his full ripeness is known to be in a rottenness. Whiles you look in the glass, it waxeth old with time, if on the sun parched with heat, if on the wind, blasted with cold. A great care to keep it, a short space to enjoy it, a sudden time to lose it. Be not coy, when you are courted. Fortune's wings are made of times feathers, which stay not whilst one may measure them. Be affable and courteous in youth, that you may be honoured in age. Roses that lose their colours, keep their savours, and plucked from the stalk, are put to the still. Cotonea,<pb facs="9"/> because it boweth when the sun riseth, is sweetest, when it is oldest: and children, which in their tender years sow courtesy, shall in their declining states reap pity.

Doth Sapho bewitch thee, whom all the ladies in Sicily could not woo: yea, poor Phao, the greatness of thy mind is far above the beauty of thy face, and the hardness of thy fortune beyond the bitterness of thy words. Die Phao, Phao die: for there is no hope if thou be wise, nor safety, if thou be fortunate. Ah Phao, the more thou seekest to suppress those mounting affections, they soar the loftier, and the more thou wrestlest with them the stronger they wax, not unlike unto a ball, which the harder it is thrown against the earth, the higher it boundeth into the air: or our Sicilian stone, which groweth hardest by hammering. Oh divine love, and therefore divine, because love, whose deity no conceit can compass, and therefore no authority can constrain, as miraculous in working as mighty, and no more to be suppressed then comprehended. How now Phao, whither art thou carried, committing idolatry with that God, whom thou hast cause to blaspheme. O Sapho, fair Sapho; peace miserable wretch, enjoy thy care in covert, we are willow in thy hat, and bays in thy heart. Lead a lamb in thy hand, and a fox in thy head, a dove on the back of thy hand, and a sparrow in the palm. Gold boileth best, when it bubbleth least, water runneth smoothest, where it is deepest. Let thy love hang at thy heart's<pb facs="12"/> bottom, not at the tongue's brim. Things untold, are undone, there can be no greater comfort, than to know much, nor any less labour, than to say nothing. But ah thy beauty Sapho, thy beauty. Beginnest thou to blab? I blab it Phao, as long as thou blabbest her beauty. Bees that die with honey, are buried with harmony. Swans that end their lives with songs, are covered when they are dead, with flowers: and they that till their latter gasp commend beauty, shall be ever honoured with benefits. In these extremities I will go to none other oracle âª than Sibylla, whose old years have not been idle in these young attempts, and whose sound advice may mitigate (Though the heavens cannot remove) my miseries.

Be always in sight, but never slothful. Flatter I mean, lie, little things catch light minds, and fancy is a worm, that feedeth first upon fennel. Imagine with thyself all are to be won, otherwise mine advice were as unnecessary as thy labour. It is unpossible for the brittle mettle of women to withstand the flattering attempts of men: only this, let them be asked, their sex requireth no less, their modesties are to be allowed so much. Be prodigal in praises and promises, beauty must have a trumpet, and pride a gift. Peacocks never spread their feathers, but when they are flattered, and gods are seldom pleased, if they be not bribed. There is none so foul, that thinketh not herself fair. In commending thou canst lose no labour. for of every one thou shalt be believed. O simple women, that are brought rather to believe what their ears hear of flattering men, then what their eyes see in true glasses.</p>

The wooden horse entered Troy, when the soldiers were quaffing, and Penelope forsooth, whom fables make so coy, among the pots wrong her wooers by the fists, when she lowered on their faces. Grapes are mind glasses. Venus worketh in Bacchus' press, and bloweth fire upon his liquor. When thou talkest with her, let thy speech be pleasant, but not incredible. Choose such words as may (As many may) melt her mind. Honey rankleth, when it is eaten for pleasure and fair words wound, when they are heard for love. Write, and persist in writing, they read more than is written to them, and write less than they think. In conceit study to be pleasant in attire brave, but not too<pb facs="13"/> curious, when she smileth laugh outright, if rise, stand up, if sit, lie down. Loose all thy time to keep time with her. Can you sing, show your cunning, can you dance, use your legs, can you play upon any instrument, practise your fingers to please her fancy, seek out qualities. If she seem at the first cruel, be not discouraged. I tell the a strange thing, women strive, because they would be overcome, force they call it: but such a welcome force they account it, that continually, they study to be enforced. To fair words join sweet kisses, which if they gently receive, I say no more, they will gently receive. But be not pinned always on her sleeves, strangers have green rushes, when daily guests are not worth a rush. Look pale, and learn to be lean, that who so seeth thee, may say, the gentleman is in love. Use no sorcery to hasten thy success, wit is a witch, Ulysses was not fair, but wise, not cunning in charms, but sweet in speech, whose filed tongue made those enamoured that sought to have him enchanted. Be not coy, bear, sooth, swear, die to please thy lady, these are rules for poor lovers, to others I am no mistress. He hath wit enough, that can give enough. Dumb men are eloquent, if they be liberal. Believe me great gifts are little gods. When thy mistress doth bend her brow, do not thou bend thy fist. Camokes must be bowed with sleight, not strength, water to be trained with pipes, not stopped with sluices, fire to be quenched with dust, not with swords. If thou have a rival, be patient, art must wind him out not malice: time, not might, her change, and thy constancy. Whatsoever she weareth: swear it becomes her. In thy louce be secret. Venus' coffers, though they be hollow, never sound, and when they seem emptiest, they are fullest. Old fool that I am, to do thee good, I begin to dote, and counsel that, which I would have concealed. Thus Phao have I given thee certain regards, no rules, only to set thee in the way, not to bring thee home.</p>

Thy tortoise have I nourished under my fig tree, my chamber have I ceiled with thy cockleshells, and dipped thy spung into the freshest waters.

I perceive, but too late I perceive, and yet not too late, because at last, that strains are caught as well by stooping too low, as reaching too high: that eyes are bleared as soon with vapours that come from the earth, as with beams that proceed from the sun.

Into the nest of an halcyon no bird can enter but the halcyon, and into the heart of so great a lady can any creep but a great lord? There is an herb (Not unlike unto my love) which the further it groweth from the sea, the salter it is, and my desires the more they swerve from reason, the more seem they reasonable. When Phao cometh, what then? wilt thou open thy love? Yea. No Sapho: but staring in his face till thine eyes dazzle, and thy spirits faint, die before his face: than this shall be written on thy tomb, that though thy love were greater than wisdom could endure; yet thine honour was such, as love could not violate, Mileta?</p>

And then pitifully casting up his eyes, he cried in such terms (As I imagined) as might either condemn the nature of such a tree, or the daring of such a mind. Whilst he lay quaking upon the ground, and I gazing one the cedar, I might perceive ants to breed in the rind coveting only to hoard, and caterpillars to cleave to the leaves, labouring only to suck, which caused more leaves to fall from the tree, then there did feathers before from the dove. Methought Mileta, I sighed in my sleep, pitying both the fortune of the bird, and the misfortune of the tree but in this time quills began to bud again in the bird, which made him look as though he would fly up, and then wished I that the body of the tree would bow, that he might but creep up the tree, then and so âª heigh, ho.</p>

This arrow is feathered with the wings of Aegitus, which never sleepeth for fear of his hen: the head touched with the stone Perillus, which causeth mistrust and jealousy. Shoot this, Cupid, at men that have fair wives, which will make them rub the brows, when they swell in the brains. This shaft is headed with Lydian steel, which striketh a deep disdain of thatwhich we most desire, thefeathers are of turtle, but dipped in the blood of a tigress, draw this up close to the head at Sapho, that she may despise, where now she dotes. Good my boy, gall her on the side, that for Phaos' love she may never sigh. This arrow is feathered with the phoenix wing, and headed with the eagle's bill, it maketh men passionate in desires, in love constant, and wise in conveyance, melting as it were their fancies into faith: this arrow, sweet child, and with as great aim as thou canst, must Phao be stricken withal, and cry softly to thyself in the very loose, Venus. Sweet Cupid mistake me not, I will make a quiver for that by itself. The fourth hath feathers of the peacock, but glued with the gum of the myrtle tree, headed with fine gold, and fastened with brittle chrysocolla: this shoot at dainty and coy ladies, at amiable and young nymphs, choose no other white but women: for this will work liking in their minds, but not love affability in speech, but no faith, courtly favours, to be<pb facs="23"/> mistresses over many, but constant to none: sighs to be fetched from the lungs, not the heart, and tears to be wrong out with their fingers, not their eyes, secret laughing at men's pale looks and neat attire, open rejoicing at their own comeliness and men's courting. Shoot this arrow among the thickest of them, whose bosoms lie open, because they would be stricken with it. And seeing men term women Jupiter's fools, women shall make men Venus' fools. This shaft is lead in the head, and whose feathers are of the night raven, a deadly and poisoned shaft, which breedeth hate only against those which sue for love. Take heed Cupid thou hit not Phao with this shaft: for then shall Venus perish. This last is an old arrow, but newly mended, the arrow which hit both Sapho and Phao, working only in mean minds an aspiring to superiors, and in high estates a stooping to inferiors: with this Cupid I am galled myself, till thou have galled Phao with the other.</p>

No, sweet Phao, Venus will obtain because she is Venus. Not thou Jove with thunder in thy hand, shalt take him out of my hands. I have new arrows now for my boy, and fresh flames, at which the gods shall tremble, if they begin to trouble me. But I will expect the event, and tarry for Cupid at the forge âª</p>

Loues are but smokes, which vanish in the seeing, and yet hurt whilst they are seen. A ferry Phao, no the stars cannot call it a worser fortune. Range rather over the world, forswear affections, entreat for death. O Sapho, thou haste Cupid in thine arms, I in my heart, thou kissest him for sport, I must curse him for spite: yet will I not curse him Sapho, whom thou kissest. This shall be my resolution, wherever I wander, to be as I were ever kneeling before Sapho, my loyalty unspotted, though unrewarded.

        <p xml:id="A06625-e111190">They that tread in a maze, walk oftentimes in one path, and at the last come out where they entered in. We fear we have led you all this while in a labyrinth of conceits, divers times hearing one device, and have now brought you to an end, where we first began. Which wearisome travail, you must impute to the necessity of the history, as Theseus did his labour to the art of the labyrinth. There is nothing causeth such giddiness, as going in a wheel, neither can there any thing breed such tediousness, as hearing many words uttered in a small compass. But if you accept this dance of a fairy in a circle, we will hereafter at your wills frame our fingers to all forms. And so we wish every one of you a thread to lead you out of the doubts, wherewith we leave you entangled: that nothing be mistaken by our rash oversights, nor misconstrued by your deep insights.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
