           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

But that being passed, he had died upon the hook, nor could the intercession of Virgilius letters have deferred the doom, though he bestrid him in the heat of battle, had not the far-famed Sophia, in his approaching fate, called to mind that which he (Though an enemy) protected her brother from, and in the instant kneeled and embraced Caesar's knees, divinely pleading, Pallas inspired her, and with her own beauties clothed the virgin, and with such power the goddess moved in her, that when Caesar gazed upon her blue eyes he left to be Caesar, and rather obeyed then granted, and to be her father could scarce secure him from being fettered with those white wrists which circled his imperial knees.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
