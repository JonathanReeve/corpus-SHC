Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.

        <head>To my worthy and much esteemed friend, sir Thomas Richardson, knight.</head>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100070">Sir, I now send you your long since promised Celestina, put into English clothes; I shall entreat you to give her a friendly welcome, because she is a stranger, and come purposely out of Spain into these parts, to see you, and kiss your hands. I would not accompany her with my letters of recommendation, whereby she might find the better reception. For, I must ingeniously confess, that this your Celestina is not sine scelere; yet must I tell you withal, that she cannot be harboured with you, sine utilitate. Her life is foul, but her precepts fair; her example naught, but her doctrine good; her coat ragged, but her mind enriched with many a golden sentence: and therefore take her not as she seems, but as she is; and the rather, because black sheep have as good carcases as white. You shall find this book to be like a Court-iack, which though it be black, yet holds as good liquor as your fairest flagon of silver or like the rod that Brutus offered to Apollo, which was rough and knotty without, but within, all of furbusht gold. The bark is bad, but the tree good.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100080">Vouchsafe then (Gentle sir) to take a little of this course and sour bread; it may be, your stomach being glutted with more delicate cates, may take some pleasure to restore your appetite with this homely, though not altogether unsavoury food. It is good plain household-bread, honest messeline; there is a great deal of rye in it, but the most part of it is pure wheat.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100090">Our author is but short, yet pithy: not so full of words<pb facs="3"/> as sense; each other line, being a sentence; unlike to many of your other writers, who either with the luxury of their phrases, or superfluity of figures, or superabundancy of ornaments, or other affected guildings of rhetoric, like undiscreet cooks, make their meats either too sweet, or too tart, too salt, or too full of pepper; whence it happeneth, that like greedy husbandmen, by enlarging their hand in sowing, they make the harvest thin and barren. It is not as many of your pamphlets be, like a tree without sap; a bough without frut; a nut without a kernel; flesh without bones; bones without marrow; prickles without a rose; wax without honey; straw without wheat; sulfur without gold; or shells without pearl. But you shall find sentences worthy to be written, not in fragile paper, but in cedar, or lasting cypress, not with the quill of a goose, but the feather of a phoenix; not with ink, but balsalmum; not with letters of a black tincture, but with characters of gold and azure; and deserving to be read, not only of a lascivious Clodius, or effeminate Sardanaplus, but of the gravest Cato, or severest Stoic.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100100">All which, though I know to be true, yet doubt I not, but it will meet with some detractors, who like dogs that bark by custom, will exclaim against the whole work, because some part of it seemeth somewhat more obscene, then may suit with a civil style: which as I not deny; so sithence it is written reprehensively, and not instructively, I see no reason why they should more abstain from reading a great deal of good, because they must pick it out of that which is bad; then they should refuse pearl, because it is fished for in a frothy sea; or contemn gold, because it is drawn from a dirty mine; or hate honey, because it is hived in straw; or loath silk, because it is leapt in soultage. Which kind of men I can liken to none better, than those of whom Plutarch complainth, who are of so nice a delicacy, that they will not drink a wholesome potion, unless it be given them in a golden cup, nor wear a winter garment unless it be woven of Athenian wool.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100110"><pb facs="3"/>The Lacedæmonians, who were as strict livers, and as great lovers of virtue, as any nation whatsoever; would make benefit even out of vices. But these critical companions, being of a depraved disposition, and apt in themselves to be evil, I can compare to nothing better, than the Scarabee, who overflying the most fragrant flowers, chooseth rather to settle in a cow-shard, than to light upon a rose ▪ or Noah's crow, which flew forth of the ark, and preying upon carrion, returned no more. Howsoever therefore these rigid reprehenders will not stick to say of Celestina, that she is like a crow amongst so many swans; like a grasshopper amongst so many nightingales; or like a paper-blur amongst so many famous writers; yet they that are learned in her language, have esteemed it (In comparison of others) as gold, amongst metals; as the carbuncle amongst stones; as the rose amongst flowers; as the palm amongst trees; as the eagle amongst birds; and as the sun amongst inferior lights; in a word, as the choicest and chiefest. But as the light of that great planet doth hurt sore eyes, and comfort those that are sound of sight: so the reading of Celestina, to those that are profane, is as poison to their hearts; but to the chaste, and honest mind, a preservative against such inconveniences as occur in the world.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100120">And for mine own part, I am of opinion, that writers may as well be born withal, as painters, who now and then paint those actions that are absurd. As Timomachus painted Medea killing her children; Orestes, murdering his mother Theo, and Parrhasius; Ulysses counterfeited madness, and Cherephanes, the immodest embracements of women with men. Which the spectators beholding, do not laudare remembering, sed; artem not commend the matter which is expressed in the imitation, but the art and skill of the workman, which hath so lively represented what it proposed. In like sort, when we read the filthy actions of whores, their wicked conditions, and beastly behaviour, we are neither to approve them as good, nor to embrace them as honest, but to commend the author's judgement in expressing<pb facs="4"/> his argument so fit and pat to their dispositions.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100130">Nor do I see any more reason, why a man should prove a villain by reading of other men's villainies, than a man should grow hard-favoured, by looking Thirsites in the face, or a fool, for viewing will summer's picture: but might rather grow as the Lacedæmonians did by their slave's drunkenness, to a detestation of so foul a sin. When therefore thou shalt read of Celestina, as of a notorious bawd; of Sempronio and Parmeno, as of false servants; of Elicia and Areusa, as of cunning queans and professed whores; of Centurio, as of a swaggering ruffian, and common whoremaster; of Calisto and Melibea, as of undiscreet and foolish lovers. And so in the rest, learn thereby to distinguish between good and bad, and praise the author, though not the practice; for these things are written more for reprehension, than imitation. And the mind that comes so instructed, can never take harm; for it will take the best, and leave the worst: but he that reads all things alike, and equally entertains them in his thought, that reader shall easily show himself obnoxious to many vices: and it shall happen unto him, as it did unto those who imitated Plato's crookedness, or Demosthenes' stammering. But when a reader shall light upon unworthy lines, I would have him cry out as a philosopher adviseth on the like occasion; male hoc, et inconvenienter. But when he meets with good; rectè hoc et decorè. As the bee feeds upon flowers, and the goat on the tops of herbs; so would I have him that reads Celestina, graze like a horse on that which is sweet and wholesome grass; and not like a hungry dog, which snatches and bites at every thing that comes in his way. Socrates, when he saw a dishonest woman, would either turn his head aside, or cover his eyes with his cloak; taking whores to be like coals, which either black or burn. Indeed, it was the wisest way for Socrates; for though he were a philosopher, yet withal he was a wanton: and therefore, for such as cannot look, but must offend in viewing of the loose● lines, I would have them imitate the lightning, which vanisheth,<pb facs="4"/> before it scarce appears; or your abortives, which die, before they be born. But for as those that are truly honest, and of that perfect temper of goodness, that nothing can make them decline from the rule of virtue, I would wish them to do with some pieces in this book (Yet to read all, and where they find anything unseemly) as the priests of old were wont to do, who in their sacrifices unto Juno, took forth the garbage of their beasts, and threw it behind the altar. If any phrase savour of immodesty, blame not me, but Celestina. If any sentence deserve commendation, praise not the translator, but the author; for I am no more to be reprehended, or commended, than the poor parrot, who accents but other folks words, and not his own.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100140">If there be any, that is either a Parmeno, or a Sempronio, an Elicia, or an Areusa, a Celestina, or a Centurio, I would have them to behold themselves in this glass; not doubting, but that as Narcissus, viewing himself in that pure clear fountain, wherein he saw his own most beautiful image, died overcome with a<seg xml:lang="unk" xml:id="A18331-e100150"> 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉</seg>, or self-love; so these men will either die, or their vices in them, through an<seg xml:lang="unk" xml:id="A18331-e100160"> 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉</seg>, or hate of themselves; at least make other men's miserable ends, serve as so many seamarks, that they may not run themselves upon the like rocks in the sea of this life; wherein all they are miserably drowned, who strike against them.</p>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100170">But to leave Celestina to a favourable censure, I must now come to entreat some favour for myself, who am so far from pleading my excuse, that I must wholly submit myself to your favourable interpretation; for I must ingeniously confess, that I have in the undergoing of this translation, shown more boldness than judgement. For though I do speak like Celestina, yet come I short of her; for she is so concisely significant, and indeed so differing is the idiom of the Spanish from the English, that I may imitate it, but not come near it. Yet have I made it as natural, as our language will give leave, and have more beaten my brains about it in some places, than a man would beat a flint to get fire; and, with much ado, have forced those<pb facs="5"/> sparks, which increasing to a greater flame, gave light to my dark understanding; wherein if I have been wanting to give it it's true life, I wish, my industry herein may awake some better wit, and judgement to perfect my imperfections, which as I shall always be willing to acknowledge; so I desire to have them mended by some better hand; nor am I any whit ashamed that any work of mine should not be absolutely perfect. For it is the statute and decree of heaven, that every composition here beneath, as well framed by the hand of art, as fashioned by the help of nature, should sustain some imperfection: for glass hath it's lead; G●● it's dross; corn it's chaff; Helen her mole; the moon her spots, and the sun its shade. My expression is but like a picture drawn with a coal, wanting those lively colours, which others more skilful might give it; and might better it as much, if they would undergo the pains; as bad faces are bettered by painting, and unsavoury meats mended by their sauces. But I am too saucy in my desire; howsoever, I will notwithstanding show myself a good christian; that though my works do not merit any reward, yet my faith and assurance is such in you, that I make no question, but my works shall be well accepted by you. In requital whereof, I will ever love you, and rest</p>

        <head>The prologue.</head>
        <p xml:id="A18331-e100210">It is the saying of that great and wise philosopher Heraclitus; that all things are created in manner of a contention, or battle. His words are these, omnia secundùm litem fiunt. A sentence in my opinion, worthy perpetual memory; and, for that most certain it is, that every word of a wise man, is pregnant, and full; of this it may be said, that through too much fullness it is ready to burst, shooting forth such spreading, and well-grown boughs and leaves, that out of the smallest sucker, or least sprig thereof, fruit enough may be gathered by men of discretion and judgement. But because my poor understanding is not able to do anymore, then to nibble on the dry bark and rugged rind of the wise sayings of those, who for the clearness and excellency of their wits, deserved to be approved; with that little which I shall pluck from thence, I will satisfy the intent and purpose of this short prologue. This sentence did I find to be strengthened by that great orator, and poet Laureate Francisco Petrarca, who tells us, sine lite atque offension nihil genuit natura parens: that nature, who is the mother of all things, engendered nothing without strife and contention. Furthermore saying, sic est enim, et sic propemodun universa testantur; rapido stellae obuiant firmamento; contraria invicem elementa confligunt; terrae tremunt; maria fluctuant; aër quati tur; crepant flammae; bellum immortal venti gerunt; tempora temporibus concertant; secum, singula; nobiscum omnia. Which is as much to say; indeed so it is, and so all things almost in the world do witness as much. The stars encounter one another in the a hirling firmament of heaven; your contrary elements wage war each with other; the earth, that<pb facs="6"/> trembles and quakes, as if it were at odds with itself; the sea, that swells and rages, breaking it's billows one against another; the air, that darteth arrows of lightning, and is moved this way and that way; the flames, they crack, and sparkle forth their fury; the winds are at perpetual enmity with themselves; times with times do contend; one thing against another, and all against us we see, that the summer makes us complain of too much heat; and the winter, of cold and sharpness of weather. So that this, which seemeth unto us a temporal revolution; this, by which we are bred up, and nourished, and live, if it once begin to pass above it's proportion, and to grow to a greater height then usual, it is no better than open war. And how much it ought to be feared, is manifested by those great earthquakes and whirlwinds, by those shipwracks and fires, as well in the air, as the earth; by the source of watercourses, and violence of inundations, by those courses, and recourses, those rackings to and fro of the clouds, of whose open motions, to know the secret cause from whence they proceed, no less is the dissension of the philosophers in the schools, then of the waves of the sea. Besides, among your bruit beasts, there is not any one of them that wants his war; be they fishes, birds, beasts, or serpents; whereof, every kind persecuteth, and pursueth one another: the lion, he pursues the wolf; the wolf the kid; the dog the hare. And if it might not be thought a fable, or old wife's tale, sitting by the fire side, I should more fully enlarge this theme. The elephant, that is so powerful and strong a beast, is afraid, and flies from the sight of a poor silly mouse; and no sooner hears him coming, but he quakes and trembles for fear. Amongst serpents, nature created the basilisk, so venomous and poisonful, and gave him such a predominant power over all the rest, that only with his hissing, he doth affright them; with his coming, put them to flight, and disperseth some one way, some another, and with his sight, kills and murders them. The viper, a crawling creature, and venomous serpent, at the time of engendering, the male puts his head into the mouth of the female, and she through the great delight, and sweetness of her pleasure, strains him so hard, that she kills him. And conceiving her young, the eldest, or first of her brood, breaks the<pb facs="6"/> bars of his mother's belly, eats out his way thorough her bowels, at which place all the rest issue forth; whereof she dies; he doing this, as a revenger of his father's death. What greater conflict, what greater contention or war can there be, than to conceive that in her body, which shall eat out her entrails? Again, no less natural dissension can we suppose to be amongst fishes; for most certain it is, that the sea doth contain as many several sorts of fishes, as the earth and air do nourish boards and beasts; and much more. Aristotle and Pliny do recount wonders of a little fish called aecheneis; how apt his nature is, and how prone his property for divers kinds of contentions, especially this one; that if he cling to a shiper carack, he will detain and stop her in her course, though she have the wind in the poop of her, and cut the seas with never so stiff a gale. Whereof Lucan maketh mention, saying,</p>

        <p xml:id="A18331-e100280">O natural contention! worthy of admiration, that a little fish should be able to do more than a great ship, with all the force and strength of the winds. Moreover, if we will discourse of birds, and of their frequent enmities, we may truly affirm, that all things are created in a kind of contention. Your greater live of rapine, as eagles and hawks; and your craven kites press upon our pullen, insulting over them even in our own houses, and offering to take them even from under the hen's wings. Of a bird called roque, which is bred in the East Indian sea, it is said to be of an incredible greatness, that the like hath never been heard of; and that with her beak, she will hoist up into the air, not only one man, or ten, but a whole ship laden with men and merchandise; and how that these miserable passengers, hanging thus in suspense in the air, till her wings wax weary, she lets them fall, and so they receive their deaths. But what shall we say of men, to whom all the foresaid creatures are subject? Who can express their wars, their jars, their enmities, their envies, their heats, their broils, their brawls, and their discontentments? That change and alteration of fashions in their apparel? That pulling down and building up of houses? and many other sundry effects<pb facs="7"/> and varieties; all of them proceeding from the feeble and weak condition of man's variable nature? And because it is an old and ancient complaint, and used heretofore time out of mind; I will not much marvel, if this present work shall prove an instrument of war to its readers, putting strifes and differences amongst them, every one giving his verdict and opinion thereupon, according to the humour of his own will. Some perhaps may say that it is too long; some too short; others to be sweet and pleasant; and other some to be dark and obscure: so that to cut it out to the measure of so many, and such different dispositions, is only appropriate to God; especially, since that it, together with all other things, whatsoever are in this world, march under the standard of this noble sentence; for even the very life of men, if we consider them from their first and tender age, till they grow gray-headed, is nothing else but a battle. Children with their sports, boys with their books, young men with their pleasures, old men with a thousand sorts of infirmities, skirmish and war continually: and these papers, with all ages. The first blots and tears them; the second knows not well how to read them; the third (Which is the cheerful livelihood of youth, and set all upon jollity) doth utterly dislike of them. Some gnaw only the bones, but do not pick out the marrow, saying there is no goodness in it; that it is a history, huddled, I know not how, together, a kind of hodgepode, or gallimaufry; not profiting themselves out of the particularities, accounting it a fable, or old wife's tale, fitting for nothing, save only for to pass away the time upon the way. Others call out the witty conceits, and common proverbs, highly commending them, but slighting and neglecting that which makes more to the purpose, and their profit. But they for whose true pleasure it is wholly framed, reject the story itself, as a vain and idle subject, and gather out the pith and marrow of the matter for their own good and benefit, and laugh at those things that savour only of wit, and pleasant conceit, storing up in their memory, the sentences and sayings of philosophers, that they may transpose them into such fit places, as may make, upon occasion, for their own use and purpose. So that when ten men shall meet together to hear this comedy, in whom perhaps shall happen this difference of dispositions, as it usually falleth out; who will deny, but that there is a contention in that<pb facs="7"/> thing which is so diversely understood? the printers, they likewise have bestowed their puncture, putting titles, and adding arguments to the beginning of every act; delivering in brief, what is more largely contained therein; a thing very excusable, in former times being much used, and in great request with your ancient writers; others have contended about the name, saying, that it ought not to be called a comedy, because it ends in sorrow and mourning, but rather termed a tragedy. The author himself would have it take it's denomination from it's beginning, which treats of pleasure, and therefore called it a comedy. So that I seeing these differences, between their extremes have parted this quarrel, by dividing it in the midst, and call it a tragicomedy. So that observing these contentions, these disagreements, these dissonant and various judgements, I had an eye, to mark whither the mayor part inclined, and found that they were all desirous, that I should enlarge myself in the pursuit of the delight of these lovers; whereunto, I have been earnestly importuned; in so much, that I have consented (Though against my will) to put now the second time my pen to this so strange a task, and so far estranged from my faculty, stealing some hours from my principal studies, together with others allotted to my recreation, though I know, I shall not want new detractors for my new edition.</p>

            <p xml:id="A18331-e100930">With me sir? there is no reason that he should go with me, who stays with you. O unfortunate, oh sudden and unexpected ill; what contrarious accident, what squint-eyed ●●ame is it that hath robbed this gentleman of his wonted mirth? and not of that alone, but of it (Which is worse) his wits. Shall I leave him all alone? or shall I go in to him? If I leave him alone, he will kill himself. If I go in, he will kill me. Let him bide alone, and bite upon the bit, come what will, come I care not. Better it is that he die, whose life is hateful unto him, then that I die, when life is pleasing unto me, and say that I should not desire to live, save only to see my Elicia, that alone is motive enough to make me look to my<pb facs="10" n="4"/> self, and guard my person from dangers: but admit he should kill himself without any other witness, then must I be bound to give account of his life. Well, I will in for that, but put case when I come in, he will take neither comfort nor counsel: marry his case is desperate, for it is a shrewd sign of death, not to be willing to be cured. Well, I will let him alone a while, and give his humour leave to work out itself; I will forbear, till his angry fit be overpast, and that his hat be come again to his colour. For I have heard say, that it is dangerous to lance or crush an impostume before it be ripe, for then it will 〈◊〉 the more: let him alone a while, let us suffer him to weep who suffers to sorrow, for tears and sighs do ease the heart that is surcharded with grief; but then again, if he see me in sight, I shall see him more incensed against me: for there the sun scorcheth most, where he reflecteth most: the sight which hath no object set before it, waxeth weary-and dull, and having its object, is as quick. And therefore I think it my best play, to play lest in sight, and to stay a little longer; but if in the meanwhile he should kill himself, than farewell he. Perhaps I may get more by it then every man is aware of, and cast my skin, changing rags for robes, and penury for plenty: but it is an old saying, he that looks after dead-men's shoes, may chance to go barefoot: perhaps also the devil hath deceived me. And so his death may be my death, and then all the fat is in the fire: the rope will go after the bucket: and one loss follow another; on the otherside, your wise men say, that it is a great ease to a grieved soul, or one that is afflicted, to have a companion, to whom he may communicate his sorrow. Besides, it is generally received, that the wound which bleeds inward, is ever the more dangerous. Why then in these two extremes hang I in suspense what I were best to do? Sure, the safest is to enter: and better it is that I should endure his anger, then for fear of his displeasure to forbear to comfort him. For, if it be possible to cure without art, and without things ready at hand, far easier is it to cure by art, and wanting nothing that is necessary.</p>

For, without these outward goods, whereof fortune is chief mistress, no man in this life comes to be happy. Lastly, the stars were so propitious at thy birth, and thyself born under so good a planet, that thou are beloved of all.</p>

Do but consider the nobleness of her blood, the ancientness of her house, the great estate she is born unto, the excellency of her wit, the splendour of her virtues, her stately, yet comely carriage, her ineffable gracefulness in all that she doth; and lastly, her divine beauty; whereof (I pray thee) give me leave to discourse a little, for the refreshing of my soul. And that which I shall tell she, shall be only of what I have discovered, and lies open to the eye: for, if I could discourse of that which is concealed, this contestation would be needless, neither should we argue thereupon so earnestly as now we do.</p>

Now, for to get her living, ye must understand, she had six several trades: she was a laundress, a perfumeress, a former of faces, a mender of cracked maidenheads, a b●●d, and had some smatch of a witch; her first trade was a cloak to all the test; under colour whereof, being withal a piece of a sempstress, many young wenches that were of<pb facs="16" n="16"/> your ordinary sorts of servants, came to her house to work: some on smocks, some on gorgets and many other things: but not one of them that came thither, but brought with her either bacon, wheat, flower, or a jar of wine, or some other the like provision, which they could conveniently steal from their mistresses, and some other thefts of greater quality, making her house (For she was the receiver, and kept all things close) the rendezvous of all their roguery: she was a great friend to your students, noble men's ca●erers, and pages: to these she sold that innocent blood of these poor miserable souls, who did easily adventure their virginities, drawn on by fair promises, and the restitution and reparation which she would make them of their lost maidenheads. Nay, she proceeded so far, that by cunning means, she had access and communication with your very vestals, and never left them, till she had brought her purpose to pass. And what time do you think she chose when she would deal with any of these? At the time of their chiefest ceremonies; as when they kept their most mysterious celebration of the feasts of their Vesta, nay, and that most strictly solemnised day of bona dea, where it is death to admit men: even then by unheard of disguises, she had her plots and projects effectually working upon them, to the utter abolition of their vows and virginity. Now, what think you, were the trades and merchandise wherein she dealt? She professed herself a kind of physician, and feigned that she had good skill in curing of little children: she would go and fetch flax from one house, and put it forth to spinning to another, that she might thereby have pretence for the freer access unto all: one would cry, here mother: and another, there mother: look, says the third, where the old woman comes: yonder comes that beldame so well known to all. Yet notwithstanding all these her cares, troubles, and trottings to and fro, being never out of action, she would never miss any great meeting, any religious procession, any nuptials, love-ties, balls, masks or games whatsoever; they were the only markets, where she made all her bargains. And at home in her own house she made perfumes, false and counterfeit storax, Benjamin, gum, anime, amber, civet, powders, musk and mosqueta: she had a chamber full of limbecks, little vials, pots, some of earth, some of glass, some brass, and some tin, formed in a thousand fashions. She made sublimated Mercury, boiled confections for to clarify the skin, waters to make the face glister, paintings, some white, some vermilion, lipsalves, scarlet-died clothes, fitted purposely for women to rub their faces therewith, ointments for to make the face smooth, lustrifications, clarifications, pargetings, farthings, waters for the morphews, and a thousand other slibber-slabbers : some made of the lees of wine, some of daffodils, some of the barks and rinds of trees, some of scar-wolf, otherwise called cittibush, or trifolium, some of taragon, some of centory, some of sour<pb facs="16" n="17"/> grapes, some of must, or new wine taken from the press, first distilled, and afterwards sweetened with sugar. She had a trick to supple and refine the skin with the juice of lemons, with turpentine, with the marrow of deer, and of heronshaws, and a thousand the like confections: she distilled sweet-waters, of roses, of flowers, of oranges, of jasmine, of three-leafed grass, of woodbine, of gillyflowers, incorporated with musk and civet, and sprinkled with wine: she made likewise lees, for to make the 〈◊〉 turn yellow, or of the colour of gold; and this she comp●●d of the sprigs of the vine, of Holme, of rye, of whorehound intermixed with saltpetre, with alum, mill-foil, which some call yarrow, or nose-bleed, together with divers other things. The oils, the butters, and the greases which she used, it is loathsome to tell you, and would turn your stomach: as of kine, bears, horses, ca●●e●s, snakes, coneys, wha●es, herons, bitterns, bucks, cats of the mountains, badgers, squirrels, hedgehogs and others. For her preparatives for bathings, it is a wonderful thing to acquaint you with all the herbs and roots which were ready gathered and hung up a-high in the roof of her house: as Ca●romill, rosemary, marshmallows, maidenhair, blue-bottle, flowers of elder, and of mustard, spike and white laurel, buds of roses, rosecakes, Gramenilla, wild-savoury, green figs, picodorae, and folia-tinct. The oils which she extracted for the face, it is incredible to recount, of storax and of jasmine, of lemons, of apple-kernels, of violets, of Ben●uy, of fistick-nuts, of pineapple kernels, of grape-stores, of Jujuba, of Axenuz or M●lanthien, of lupins, of pease, of Carilla, and Paxarera; and a small quantity of balsamum she had in a little vial, wherewith she cured that scotch given her overthwart her nose. For the mending of lost maidenheads, some she holp with little bladders, and other some she stitched up with the needle: she had in a little cabinet, or painted workbox, certain fine small needles, such as your glover's sow withal, and threads of the slenderest and smallest silk, rubbed over with wax: she had also roots hanging there of folia-plasme, fuste-sanguinio, Squill or sea-onion, and ground thistle. With these she did work wonders; and when the French ambassador came thither, she made sale of one of her wenches, three several times for a virgin.</p>

In another partition, she had her knacks for to help those that were lovesick, and to make them to be beloved again, and obtain their desires. And for this purpose, she had the bones that are bred in a stag's heart, the tongue of a viper, the heads of quails the brains of an ass, the calls of young colts, when they are new foaled, the bearing cloth of a newborn babe, Barbary beans, a sey-compasse,<pb facs="17" n="18"/> a horn-fish, the halter of a man that hath been hanged, juice berries, the prickles of a hedgehog, the foot of a badger, fern-seed, the stone of an eagle's nest, and a thousand other things. Many both men and women came unto her: of some she would demand a piece of that bread where they had bit it: of others, some part of their apparel: of some, she would crave to have of their hair: others, she would draw characters in the palms of their hands with saffron; with othersome she would do the same with a kind of colour, which you call vermilion: to others she would give hearts made of wax, and stuck full of broken needles; and many other the like things, made in clay, and some in lead, very fearful, and ghastly to behold: she would draw circles, portrait forth figures, and mumble many strange words to herself, having her eyes still fixed on the ground.

Besides, I would have thee to know, if thou knowest it not already, that there are these two conclusions, that are evermore infallibly true. The first is, that every man must of force love a woman, and every woman love a man. The second is, that he who truly loves, must of necessity be much troubled and moved with the sweetness of that superexcellent delight, whichwas ordained by him that made all things, for the perpetuating of mankind, without which, it must needs perish: and not only in humane kind, but also in fishes, birds, beasts, and all creatures that creep and crawl upon the earth; likewise in your souls vegetative, some plants have the same inclination and disposition, that without the interposition of any other thing, they be planted in some little distance one of another, and it is determined and agreed upon by the general-consent of your gardeners, and husbandmen, to be make and female.

But to leave off all jesting, and to come to plain earnest; hear me now (My child) and harken what I shall say unto thee. For, though I am called hither for one end, I am come for another. And albeit I have made myself a stranger unto thee, and as though I knew thee not, yet thou wast the only cause that drew me hither. My son, I am sure thou art not ignorant, how that your mother gave you unto me, your father being then alive; who, after thou wentest from<pb facs="20" n="24"/> me, died of no other grief, save only what she suffered for the uncertainty of thy life and person. For whose absence in those latter years of her elder age, she led a most painful, pensive and careful life. And when the time came, that she was to leave this world, she sent for me, and in secret recommended thee unto me, and told me, (No other witness being by, but heaven the witness to 〈◊〉 our works, our thoughts, our hearts, whom she alone interpose between her and me) that of all loves I should do so much 〈◊〉, as to make inquiry after thee, and when I had found thee, 〈◊〉 thee up, and foster thee as mine own: and that as soon as thou 〈◊〉 come to man's estate, and wert able to know how to govern thyself, and to live in some good manner and fashion; that then I should discover unto thee a certain place, where, under many a lock and key, she hath left thee more store of gold and silver, than all the revenues come to, that thy master Calisto hath in his possession. And because I solemnly vowed, and bound myself by promise unto her, that I would see her desire, as far forth as lay in me, to be well and truly performed, she peacefully departed this mortal life; and though a man's faith ought to be inviolably observed both to the living and the dead, yet more especially to the dead; for they are not able to do any thing of themselves, they cannot come to me, and prosecute their right here upon earth. I have spent much time and money in enquiring and searching after thee, and could never till now hear what was become of thee: and it is not above three days since, that I first heard of your being, and where you abode. Verily, it hath much grieved me, that thou hast gone travelling, and wandering throughout the world, as thou hast done from place, to place, losing thy time, without either gain of profit, or of friends. For, (As Seneca saith) travellers have many ends, and few friends. For, in so short a time they can never fasten friendship with any: and he that is everywhere , is said to be nowhere . Again, that meat cannot benefit the body, which is no sooner eaten, then ejected. Neither doth any thing more hinder it's health, than your diversities, and changes of meats. Nor doth that would come to be healed, which hath daily change of tents, and never plasters. Nor doth that tree never prove, which is often transplanted and removed from one ground to another. Nor is there any thing too profitable, which at the first sight bringeth profit with it ▪ therefore (My good son) leave off these violences of youth, and following the doctrine, and rule of thy ancestors, return unto reason, settle thyself in some one place or other. And where better, than where I shall advise thee, taking me, and my counsel along with thee, to whom thou art recommended both by thy father and mother? And I, as if I were thine own true mother, say unto thee, upon those curses and maledictions, which thy parents have laid upon thee, if thou shouldst be disobedient unto me, that yet a while thou continue here, and serve this thy master which thou hast gotten thee, till thou hearest<pb facs="20" n="25"/> further from me, but not with that foolish loyalty, and ignorant honesty, as hitherto thou hast done; thinking to find firmness upon a false foundation, as most of these masters now a day's are. But do thou gain friends, which is a durable and lasting commodity; stick closely and constantly unto them; do not thou live upon hopes, relying on the vain promises of masters, who suck away the substance of their servants, with hollow-hearted, and idle promises, as the horseleeches suck blood; and in the end fall off from them, wrong them, grow forgetful of their good services, and deny them any recompense or reward at all. Woe be unto him that grows old in court. The masters of these times love more themselves then their servants; neither in so doing do they do amiss. The like love ought servants to bear unto themselves. Liberality was lost long ago; rewards are grown out of date; magnificence is fled the country; and with her, all nobleness. Every one of them is wholly now for himself, and makes the best he can of his servant's service, serving his turn, as he finds it may stand with his private interest and profit. And therefore they ought to do no less, sithence that they are less than they in substance, but to live after their law, and to do as they do. My son Parmeno, I the rather tell thee this, because thy master (As I am informed) is (As it seemeth ▪ likewise unto me) a rompenecios, one that befools his servants, and wears them out to the very stumps, looks for much service at their hands, and makes them small, or no recompense: he will look to be served of all, but will part with nothing at all. Weigh well my words, and persuade thyself, that what I have said is true: get thee some friends in his house, which is the greatest, and preciousest jewel in the world. For, with him thou must not think to fasten friendship. A thing seldom seen, where there is such difference of estate and condition, as is between you two. Opportunity, thou seest, now offers herself unto us, on whose foretop, if we will but take hold, we shall all of us be great gainers, and thou shalt presently have something, wherewithal to help thyself. As for that which I told you of, it shall be well and safely kept, when time shall serve; in the meanwhile , it shall be much for thy profit, that thou make Sempronio thy friend.</p>

Nor do thou think, that this thy inwardness with thy master can any way secure thee. For the greater a man's fortune is, the less secure it is; and then most ticklish, when most prosperous. And therefore, to be armed against misfortunes, we must arm ourselves with friends. And where canst thou get a fitter, nearer, and better companion in this kind, then where those three kind of friendships do concur in one? To wit, goodness, profit, and pleasure. For goodness; behold the good will of Sempronio, how agreeable, and conformable it is to thine: and with it, the great similiancy, and suitableness, which both of you have in virtue: for profit; that lies in this hand of mine, if you two can but agree together: for pleasure, that likewise is very likely.

And delight is with friends, in things that are sensual; but especially in recounting matters of love, and communicating them, the one to the other. This did I do myself; this such a one told me; such a jest did we break; in this sort did I win her; thus often did I kiss her: thus often did she bite me; thus I embraced her; thus came we nearer and nearer.

I am doubtful of following her council: it is as great an error to believe nothing, as it is to believe every thing. The more humane and civil course is, to have affiance and confidence in her. Especially in that, where besides the present benefit, both profit and pleasure is proposed. I have heard tell; that a man should believe his betters, and those whose years carry authority with them. Now; what is it she adviseth me unto? To be at peace with Sempronio: and to peace, no man ought to be opposite. For blessed are the peaceful. Love and charity towards our brothers, that is not to be shunned and avoided by us; and few are they, that will forgo their profit. I will therefore seek to please her, and hearken unto her. Mother, a master ought not be offended with his scholar's ignorance; at least, very seldom in matters of depth and knowledge. For though knowledge in its own nature, be communicable unto all, yet is it infused but into few. And therefore I pray pardon me, and speak a new unto me; for, I will not only hear and believe thee, but receive thy council as a singular kindness, and a token of thy great favour, and especial love towards me. Nor yet would I, that you should thank me for this; because the praise and thanks of every action, ought rather to be attributed<pb facs="22" n="29"/> to the giver then to the receiver.

He sometimes would maintain hard and strange propositions, but would presently (Such was the goodness of his nature) see his error, and embrace the truth ▪ I swear unto thee; that in thus seeing thee to thwart the truth, and then suddenly upon it, laying down all contradiction, and to be conformable to that which was reason; methinks , I do as lively now behold thy father: as if he now were living, and present here before me.

And for what end is fortune favourable and prosperous, but to be a handmaid to our honour, and to wait thereon, which of all worldly goods is the greatest? For honour is the reward and recompense of virtue; and for this cause we give it unto the divine essence, because we have not any thing greater to give him. The best part whereof consisteth in liberality and bounty: and this close-fistedness, and uncommunicated treasure, doth eclipse and darken, whereas magnificence and liberality doth gain, and highly extol it. What good is it for a man to keep that to himself, which in the keeping of it, does himself no good? I tell you, sir, and what I speak is truth; better is the use of riches, than the possessing of them. O, how glorious a thing is it to give? and how miserable to<pb facs="23" n="31"/> receive? See, how much better action is then passion: so much more noble is the giver, than the receiver. Amongst the elements, the fire, because it is more active, is the more noble: and therefore placed in the spheres, in the noblest place. And some say; that nobleness is a praise proceeding from the merit, and antiquity of our ancestors. But I am of opinion, that another man's light can never make you shine, unless you have some of your own. And therefore do not glory in the nobleness of your father, who was so magnificent a gentleman, but in your own. Shine not out of his, but your own light; and so shall you get yourself honour, which is man's greatest outward good. Wherefore not the bad, but the good, (Such as yourself) are worthy to partake of so perfect a virtue. And besides, I must tell you, that perfect virtue doth not suppose that honour hath it's fellow: and therefore rejoice with yourself, that you have been so magnificent, and so bountiful. And thus, sir, having told you my mind, let me now advise you that you would be pleased to return back to your chamber, and there take some rest, sithence, that your business is deposited in such hands; assuring yourself, that the beginning being so good, the end will be much better: and so let us go presently to your chamber; where I shall treat more at large with you concerning this business.</p>

            <p xml:id="A18331-e106130"> methinks (Sempronio) it is no good counsel, that I shouldst here accompanied, and that she should go all alone, who seeks to cure my ill: it were better that thou shouldst go along with her, and hasten her on, since thou knowest, that on her diligence dependeth my welfare; on her slowness, my painfulness, on her neglect, my despair. Thou art wise, I know thee to be faithful, I hold thee a good servant. And therefore so handle the matter, that she shall no sooner see thee, but that she may judge of that pain which I feel, and of that fire which tormenteth me; whose extreme heat will not give me leave to lay open unto her the third part of my secret sickness. So did it tie my tongue, and took such hold on my senses, that they were not only busied, but in a manner wasted and consumed; which thou, as one that is free from the like passion, mayst more largely deliver, letting thy words run with a looser rein.</p>

For, if I leave you thus all alone, you will talk idly, like one that is distracted; do nothing but sigh, weep, and take on, shutting yourself up in darkness, desiring solitude, and seeking new means of thoughtful torment; wherein if you still persevere, you cannot escape either death or madness. For the avoiding whereof, get some good company<pb facs="24" n="32"/> about you, that may minister unto you occasion of mirth, by recounting of witty conceits, by entertaining you with music, and singing merry songs, by relating storeys, by devising mottoes, by telling tales, by playing at cards, jesting, sporting.

The ease lies in the forgetting it. Kick not therefore against the prick, feign thyself to be merry, pluck up your spirits and be of good cheer, and all, you shall see, shall be well: for oftentimes, opinion brings things whither it listeth: not that it should cause us to swerve from the truth; but for to teach us to moderate our se●ce, and to govern our judgement.</p>

For one that thou eatest being ripe, thou croppest a thousand that are green; for were she alive, these my steps should not have been unaccompanied, not driven (As now I am) to walk the streets alone.

And by my say, I swear unto thee, she would go barefaced from one end of the city to the other, with her fan in her hand, and not one, all the way that she went, would give her any worse word, than mistress Claudina. And I dare be bold to say it, that there was not a woman of a better palate for wine in the world, nor better skilled in any kind of merchandise whatsoever. And when you have thought that she had been scarce out of doors, with a whip-sir John, ere you could scarce say this, she was here again. Every one would invite and feast her, so great was the affection which they bore unto her; and she never came home, till she had taken a taste of some eight or ten sorts of wine, bearing one pottle in her jar, and the other in her belly: and her credit was so good, that they would have trusted her for a roundlet or two upon her bare word, as if she had pawned unto them a piece of plate. Why, her word was as currant as gold, in all the inns and taverns in the town. If we walked the streets, whensoever we found ourselves thirsty, we entered straight the next tavern that was at hand, and called presently for a quart of wine for to moisten our mouths withal, though we had not a penny to pay for it. Nor would they (As from others) take our veils and our coifs from off our heads, till we had discharged the reckoning, but score it up, and so let us go on our way. O Sempronio; were it but<pb facs="28" n="40"/> cat after kind, and that such were the son, as was the mother, assure thyself that thy master should remain without a feather, and we without any farther care.

Melibea is fair; Calisto fond and frank; he cares not to spare his purse, nor I my pains; he is willing to spend, and I to speed him in his business; let his money be stirring, and let the suit hang as long as it will. Money can do any thing; it splitteth hard rocks; it passeth over river's dryfoot; there is not any place so high, whereunto an ass laden with gold will not get up; his unadvisedness, and ferventness of affection, is sufficient to mar him, and to make us. This I have thought upon; this I have searched into; this is all I know concerning him and her: and this is that which must make most for our profit. Well, now must I go to Pleberio's house. Sempronio, farewell. For though Melibea brave it, and stands so high upon her pantofles; yet is not she the first that I have made to stoop, and leave her cackling; they are all of them ticklish, and skittish; the whole generation of them is given to wenching and flinging: but after they are well weighed, they prove good highway jades, and travel quietly; you may kill them, but never tire them. If they journey by night, they wish it may never be morning. They curse the cocks, because they proclaim it is day: the clocks, because they go too fast: they lie prostrate, as if they looked after the Pleyades and the North star, making themselves astronomers, and star gazers; but when they see the morning star arise, they sigh for sorrow, and are ready to forsake their bodies. And the clearing of the day, is the clouding of their joy. And above all, it is worth the while, to note how quickly they change copy, and turn the cat in the pan; they entreat him, of whom they were entreated; they endure torment for him, whom before they had tormented; they are servants to those, whose mistresses they were; they break thorough stone walls, they open windows, feign sickness; if the hinges of their doors chance to creak, they anoint and supple them<pb facs="28" n="41"/> with oil, that they may perform their office without any noise. I am not able to express unto thee the great impression of that sweetness, which the primary and first kisses of him they love, leaveth imprinted in their hearts. They are enemies of the mean, and wholly set upon extremes.</p>

And because I know this to be true, it makes me go more merrily and cheerfully to Melibea's house, than if I had her fast in my fist already. For I know, that though at the first I must be forced to woo her, yet in the end, she will be glad to sue to me. And though at present perhaps she threaten me, and flatly fall out with me; yet at last will she be well pleased, and fall as much a flattering, as she did a reviling me. Here in this pocket of mine, I carry a little parcel of yarn, and other such like trinkets, which I always bear about me; that I may have some pretence at first to make my easier entrance and free access, where I am not thoroughly known: as gorgets, coifs, fringes, rolls, fillets, hair-laces, nippers, antimony, ceruse, and sublimated Mercury, needles and pins; they shall not ask that thing, which I shall not have for them.

For, those things which are not well weighed, and considered, though sometimes they take good effect, yet commonly fall out ill. So that much speculation brings forth much good fruit; for although I dissembled with him, and did set a good face on the matter, it may be, that if my drift and intent should chance to be found out by Melibea's father, it would cost me little less than my life: or at least, if they should not kill me, I should rest much impaired in my credit, either by their tossing me in a blanket, or by causing me to be cruelly whipped; so that my sweet meats shall have sour sauce: and my hundred crowns in gold<pb facs="30" n="45"/> be purchased at too dear a rate; ay wretched me● into what a labyrinth have I put myself? What a trap am I like to fall into, through mine own folly? For that I might show myself solicitous and resolute, I have put myself upon the hazard of the dice. Woe is me; what shall I do? To go back, is not for my profit; and to go on, stands not with my safety. Shall I persist? or shall I desist? In what a straight am I? In what a doubtful and strange perplexity? I know not which I were best to choose. On my daringness dependeth manifest danger; on my cowardice shameful damage. Which way shall the ox go, out he must needs plough? Every way, go which way I will, discovers to my eyes deep and dangerous furrows; desperate downfalls; if I be taken in the manner; if the theft be found about me, I shall be either killed, or carted, with a paper-crown set upon my head, having my fault written in great text-letters. But in case I should not go, what will Sempronio then say? Is this all thou canst do? Thy power, thy wisdom, thy stoutness, thy courage, thy large promises, thy fair offers, thy tricks, thy subtleties, and the great care (Forsooth) thou wouldst take; what? are they all come to this? And his master Calisto, what will he say? what will he do? or what will he think? save only this; that there is much deceit in my steps; and that I have discovered this blot to Pleberio, like a prevaricating sophistress, or cunning Ambidexter, playing the traitor on both sides, that I might gain by both? And if he do not entertain so hateful a thought, he will rail upon me like a madman; he will upbraid me to my face, with most reproachful terms; he will propose a thousand inconveniences, which my hasty deliberation was the cause of; saying, out you old whore; why didst thou increase my passions with thy promises? False bawd as thou art; for all the world besides, thy feet can walk, for me only thy tongue; others can have works; I only words. Others can have remedy at thy hands; I only the man that must endure torment. To all others, thy force can extend itself; and to me is it only wanting. To all others thou art light; to me darkness. Out thou old treacherous, disloyal wertike; why didst thou offer thyself and service unto me? For, it was thy offer that did put me in hope: and that hope did delay my death, prolonged my life, and did put upon me the title of a glad man. Now, for that thy promises have not proved effectual, neither shalt thou want punishment, nor I woeful despair: so that, look I on which side I will (Miserable man that I am) it is ill here, and it is ill there; pain and grief on either hand: but when extremes shall want their mean, and no means to avoid either the one or the other; of two cuils, it is the wiser course to incline to the lesser. And therefore I had rather offend Pleberio, then displease Calisto. Well then, I will go. For greater will my shame be, to be condemned for a coward, than my punishment, in daring to accomplish what I promised. Besides, fortune still friendeth those that<pb facs="31" n="46"/> are bold and valiant. Lo, yonder's the gate; I have seen myself in greater danger than this in my days, Coraggio, Coraggio, Celestina; be of good cheer; be not dismayed; for, there are never suitors wanting for the mitigating, and allaying of punishment. All divinations are in my favour, and show themselves prospicious in my proceedings; or else I am nobody in this my art, a mere bungler, an idiot, an ass. Of four men that I meet by the way, three of them were Ihon's; whereof two were cuckolds. The first word that I heard, passing along the street, was a love-complaint. I have not stumbled since I came forth, as at other times I used to do. He thinks the very stones of the street did sunder themselves one from another, to give me way as I passed. Nor did the skirts of my clothes rumple up in troublesome folds, to hinder my feet. Nor do I feel any faintness, or weariness in my legs. Every one saluteth me. Not a dog that hath once barked at me; I have neither seen any bird of a black feather, neither thrush, nor crow; nor any other of the like unlucky nature; and which is a better sign of good luck then all these, yonder do I see Lucrecia, standing at Melibea's gate, which is kinswoman to Elicia: it cannot but go well with us; it is impossible we should miss of our purpose; all is cocksure.</p>

And of a thousand that live contentedly, you have ten thousand do the contrary: true contentedness, rest, renown, glory, and quietness, run from the rich by other by-conduits, and gutters of subtlety and deceit; which pipes, whereby they are conveyed, are never perceived, because they are paved and bricked over with smooth and well wrought flatteries.

And a far better sleep doth the poor man take, than he who is bound to keep that with care which he hath gotten with labour, and must leave with sorrow. My friend will not dissemble with me, but the rich man's will with him; I am loved for mine own sake; the rich man for his wealth's sake. A rich man shall never hear the truth; every one will flatter him, and seek to please his humour in whatsoever he shall say. Besides, he lies open to every man's envy; and you shall scarce find one rich man amongst a thousand, but will ingeniously confess, that it had been better for him to have been in a middling estate, or in good honest poverty. For riches make not a man rich but busied; not a master, but a steward. More are they that are possessed by their riches, than they that possess their riches. To many they have been a means of their death; and most men they have robbed of their pleasure, and their good and commendable qualities; and to say the truth, they are enemies to all goodness. Have you not heard say, men have lain down, and dreamed of their riches, and behold, they have waked, and found nothing in their hands? Every rich man hath a dozen of sons, or nephews, which repeat no other prayer, nor tender any other orison to God, but that he would be pleased to take him out of this world; and desire nothing more, than to see the hour that they may come to enjoy his estate; to see him under ground, and what was his, in their hands; and with a small charge, to lay him up in his last and everlasting mansion here on earth.</p>

For mine own, I pass at home with myself in mine own house, without letting the whole country to know them: eating when I may, and drinking when I can get it. For, for all my poverty, I never wanted a penny to buy me bread, nor a quart, that is, the eighth part of six pence to send for wine, no, not in all this time of my widowhood. For before, I never took thought for any, but had always a good vessel still in my house. And when one was empty, another was full. I never went to bed, but I did first eat a toast well steeped in wine, and two dozen of draughts, sipping still the wine after every sop, for fear of the mother, wherewith I was then wont to be troubled. But now, that I husband all things myself, and am at mine own finding, I am fain to fetch my wife in a little poor jar, which will scarce hold a pottle. And sometimes in punishment of my sins (Which cross I am willing to bear) I am forced to go six times a day with these my silver hairs about my shoulders, to fill and fetch my wine myself at the tavern. Nor would I by my good will die, till I see myself have a good roundlet or terse of mine own within mine own dootes. For (On my life) there is no provision in the world like unto it. For as the saying is; it is bread and wine, not the young man that is spruce and fine, that makes us rid the way, and travel with mettle; yet let me tell you, that where the good man is missing, all other good is wanting. For ill does the spindle move, when the beard does not wag above. And this I thought good to tell you by the way, upon those speeches which I used concerning others, and not mine own necessities.</p>

Neither know I how to return thee a convenient answer, because I have not fully comprehended thy meaning; I should think myself happy, if my words might carry that force, as to save the life of any man, though never so mean. For to do good, is to be like unto the deity. Besides, he that doth a benefit, receives it when it is done to a person that desires it.

Besides, sithence we are all mortal, and born to die; as also, that it is most certain, that he cannot be said truly to be born, who is only born for himself; for then should men be like unto bruit beasts, (If not worse;) amongst which, there are some, that are very pitiful: as your unicorn, of whom it is reported, that he will humble and prostrate himself at the feet of a virgin. And your dog, for all his fierceness, and cruelness of nature, when he comes to bite another, if he throw himself down at his feet, he will let him alone, and do him no harm; and this is all out of pity. Again, to come to your birds, and fowls of the air; your cock eateth not any thing, but he first calleth his hens about him, and gives them part of his feeding. The pelican, with her beak breaketh up her own breast, that she may give her very bowels and entrails to her young ones to eat. The storks maintain their aged parents as long in the nest, as they did give them food, when they were young and unable to help themselves. Now, if God and nature gave such knowledge unto beasts and birds; why should we that are men, be more cruel one to another? Why give we not part of our graces, and of our persons, to our neighbours? Especially when they are involved and afflicted with secret infirmities, and those such, that where the medicine is, thence was the cause of the malady?</p>

Besides, it is the part of a discreet messenger, to do that which the time requires; especially, whenas the quality of the business cannot conceal or admit of dissembled ●ime. And moreover, I know that thy master (As I have heard) is liberal, and somewhat of a womanish longing; and therefore will give more for one day of good news, then for a hundred, wherein he is pained. And with his pain, mine will be increased: his in loving, and mine in trudging to and fro. For your quick and speedy pleasures beget alteration; and great alteration doth hinder deliberation. Again, where will you find goodness, but in that which is good? And nobleness of blood, but in large and long continued rewards? Peace, you fool, let me alone with him, and you shall see how your old woman will handle him.</p>

And as one standing in suspense, looking wisely and steadily upon me, somewhat amazed at the strangeness of my message, harkening very attentively, till she might come to know who this should be, that for want of a word of her mouth, lived in such great pain, and what manner of man he might be, whom her tongue was able to cure?

And when she had ended with her bugbears, she began to fall into often swoonings and trances, making many strange gestures, full of fear and amazement, all her senses being troubled, her blood boiling within her,<pb facs="44" n="72"/> throwing herself this way and that way, bearing in a strange kind of manner the members of her body one against another; and then in a strong and violent fashion, being wounded with that golden shaft, which at the very voicing of your name, had struck her to the heart, writhing and winding her body, her hands and fingers being clinched one within another, like one struggling and striving for life, that you would have thought, she would have rent them asunder, hurling and rolling her eyes on every side, striking the hard ground with her tender feet. Now, I all this while, stood me still in a corner, like a cloth that is shrunk in the wetting, as close as I could for my life, not saying so much as any one word unto her; yet glad with all my heart, to see her in this cruel and pitiful taking. And the more her throws and pangs were, the more did I laugh in my sleeve at it; because I thereby knew, her yielding would be the sooner, and her fall the nearer: yet must I tell you, that whilst her anger did foam out it's froth, I did not suffer my thoughts to be idle, nor give them leave to run a woolgathering, but recollecting myself, and calling my wits about me, I took hold on time's foretop, and found a salve to heal that hurt, which myself had made.</p>

Every man, ear hath been filled with the good reports I have made of thee. The reason thereof I need not to repeat; for I ever held thee to be my son, at least, by adoption; and therefore thought thou wouldst have showed thyself more natural and loving towards me. But in stead thereof, thou gavest me bad payment, even to my face; crossing, whatsoever I said; thinking ill of all that I spoke; whispering and murmuring against me in the presence of Calisto. I was well persuaded, that after thou hadst once yielded to my good counsel, that you would not have turned your heel, and kicked against me as you did, nor have fallen off from your promise. But notwithstanding all this, I perceive some old relic yet still remaining of my former folly. And so speaking rather to satisfy thine own humour, then that thou canst render any reason for it; thou dost hinder thyself of profit, to give thy tongue contentment. Hear me (My son) if thou hast<pb facs="48" n="81"/> not heard me already. Look I, say, and consider with thyself, that I am old, and well strucken in years; and good counsel only lodgeth with the elder sort, it being proper to youth, to follow pleasure and delight. But my hope is, that of this thy error, thy youth only is in fault: and I trust that you will bear yourself better towards me hereafter, and that you will alter your ill purpose, together with your tender years; for as it is in the proverb: our customs suffer change, together with our hairs; and we vary our disposition, as we vary our years. I speak this (My son) because as we grow in age, so grow we in experience; new things daily offering themselves to our view: for youth looks no farther than to things present, occupying his eye only in that he sees set before him; but riper years omit neither things present, things past, nor things to come. And son Parmeno, if you would but bethink yourself of the love I have heretofore born you, I know it cannot escape your knowledge, that the first night's lodging that you took, when you were a stranger, and came newly to this city, was in my house. But you young men care not for us that are old; but govern yourselves according to the savour and relish of your own palates; you never think that you have, or shall have need of us: you never think upon sickness; you never think, that this flower of your youth shall fade. But do you hear me, (My friend) and mark what I say unto you; that in such cases of necessity, as these, an old woman, (Be she well experienced) is a good help, a comforter, a friend, a mother; nay, more than a mother: a good inn, to give ease and rest to a sound man; and a good hospital for to cure a sick man; a good purse in time of need; a good chest, to keep money in prosperity; a good fire in winter, environed with spits of good roast-meat; a good shade in summer, and a good tavern to eat and drink in. Now my pretty little fool, what sayest thou to all this? What dost thou think of it? I know, thou art by this time ashamed of that which thou hast spoken today; thou canst not say b to a battledoor; thou art struck so dumb, and so dead: and therefore I will press thee no further, nor crave any more at thy hands, then that which friendship craves of thee, which is, look upon Sempronio; next under heaven, myself have made him a man; I could wish you would live and love together as brothers and friends: for being in league with him, thou shalt live in the favour and love of thy master, and in good repute with all the world: for Sempronio, I tell thee, is well beloved, he is diligent, a good courtier, a proper servant, a fellow of a good fashion, and one that is willing to embrace thy friendship, which will turn to both your profits, if you will but handfast your affections each to other. Besides, you know, that you must love, if you will be beloved. Trouts cannot be taken with dry breeches. And if the cat will have fish, she must wet her foot. Nor does Sempronio owe this of right unto thee; nor is he bound to love thee, unless thou exchange love for love: it is mere<pb facs="49" n="82"/> simplicity, not to be willing to love, and yet look to be beloved of others. And as great folly, to repay friendship with hatred.</p>

O! had I in all this world, but such another friend? Such another companion? Such a comfortress in my troubles? Such an easer, and lightner of my heart's heaviness? Who did supply my wants? Who knew my secrets? To whom did I discover my heart? Who was all my happiness, and quietness, but thy mother? She was nearer and dearer unto me, than my gossip, or mine own sister. O! how well-favoured was she, and cheerful of countenance? How lusty? How quick? How neat? How portly and majestical in her gate? How stout and manly? Why, she would go you at midnight without or pain,<pb facs="50" n="84"/> or fear, from Church-yard, to Church-yard, seeking for implements appertaining to our trade, as if it had been day. Nor did she omit either Christians, Moors, or Jews, whose graves and sepulchres she did not visit. By day she would watch them, and by night she would dig them out; taking such things as should serve her turn. So that she took as great pleasure in darkness of the night, as thou dost comfort in the brightness of the day. She would usually say; that the night was the sinful man's cloak, that did hide and cover all his rogueries, that they might not be seen, though perhaps she had not the like dexterity and skill in all the rest of those tricks that appertained to her trade: yet one thing shall I tell thee, because thou shall see what a mother thou hast lost, though I was about to keep it in; but it makes no matter, it shall out to thee. She did pull out seven teeth out of a fellow's head that was hanged, with a pair of pincers, such as you pull out stubbed hairs withal; whilst I did pull off his shoes. She was excellent at a circle, and would enter it far better than myself, and with greater boldness, though I also was very famous for it in those days, more I wiss, than I am now; who have together with her, lost almost my cunning. What shall I say more unto thee, but that the very devils themselves did live in fear of her? She did hold them in horror, and dread, making them to tremble and quake, when she began to exercise her exorcisms, her spells, her incantations, her charms, her conjurations, and other words of most horrisonous roaring, and most hideous noise. She was as well known to them all, as the beggar knows his dish; or as thyself in thine own house. One devil coming tumbling in upon the neck of another, as fast, as it pleased her to call them up, and not one of them durst tell her a lie; such power had she to bind them: so that ever since she died, I could never attain to the truth of any thing. Parmeno, may this woman no better thrive, than she pleaseth me with those her wordy praises.</p>

Yet all this was nothing; for men must suffer something in this wicked world, for to uphold their lives, and their honours. And mark, I pray, what small reckoning they made of it, because of her great wisdom and discretion. For she would not for all this, give over her old occupation; and from that day forward followed it more earnestly, than she did before, and with happier proof. This I thought good to tell you, to cross that opinion of yours, touching perseverance in that, wherein we have once already erred; for all that she did, did so well become her, and such a grace had she with her, that upon my conscience, howbeit she stood thus disgracefully<pb facs="51" n="86"/> upon the scaffold, every one might perceive, that she cared not a button for those that stood beneath, staring and gazing upon her; such was her behaviour and carriage at that instant: look they might their fill, but I warrant you, she was not a farthing in debt, no not to the proudest of them all; wherein, I thought fit to instance, to show thereby unto you; that they, who have any thing in them as she had, and are wise, and of worth, fall far more easily and sooner into error, than any other. Do but weigh and consider with yourself, what a manner of man Virgil was; how wise in all kind of knowledge; and yet I am sure you have heard, how in a wicker basket he was hung out from a tower, all Rome looking upon him; yet for all this, was he neither the less honoured, neither lost he the name of Virgil. </p>

But because she was a woman of a great spirit, and good courage, and her heart had been accustomed to endure, she made matters lighter than they were; and of all this, she reckoned not a pin: for a thousand times have I heard her say; if I broke my leg, it was all for my good; for this made me better known than I was before.

Go to, go to, (Daughter) you are to blame if it be so, and I tell you, it is a shame for you, that it is, not to impart these good graces and blessings, which heaven hath bestowed upon you, to as many as wish you well; for they were not given you in vain, that you should let them wither, and lose the flower of your youth under six linings of woollen, and linen; have a care, that you be not covetous of that, which cost you but little; do not like, a miser,<pb facs="52" n="91"/> hoard up your beauty; make not a hidden treasure of it, sithence in it's own nature it is as communicable, and as commonly currant as money from man to man.

Every strong scent is good: as pennyroyal, rue, wormwood, smoke of partridge feathers, of rosemary, and of the soles of old shoes, and of musk-roses, of incense, of strong perfumes, received kindly, fully, and greedily, doth work much good; much slaketh and easeth the pain, and by little and little returns the mother to it's proper place.

What would you then do, were he now in town? It hath ever been my ill fortune, to give counsel unto fools, such as cannot see their own good; say what I will, they will err; still stand in their own light. But I do not much wonder at it; for though the world be wide, yet there are but few wise in it. Great is the largeness of the earth, but small the number of those that have experience. Ha, daughter! Did you but see your cousin's wisdom, or but know what benefit my breeding, and counsel hath brought her, how cunning, how witty, and what a mistress in her art; you would be of another mind; say, what I will unto her, she patiently endures my reprehensions, she hearkens to my advice, and does all what I will have her do; she will sometimes boast, that she hath at one time had one in bed with her; another waiting at the door; and a third sighing for her within the house; and yet hath given good satisfaction to them all. And art thou afraid, who hast but two to deal withal; can one cock fill all thy cisterns? One conduit-pipe water all thy court? If this be your diet, you may chance to rise a hungered, you shall have no meat left against another time; I will not rent your fragments; I cannot live upon scraps; one could never please me; I could never place all my affection upon one; two can do more than one; they give more, and they have more to give. It goes hard (Daughter) with that mouse, that hath but one hole to trust to; for if that be stopped, she hath no means to hide herself from the cat: he that hath but one eye, you see in what danger he goes? One sole act maketh not a habit. It is a rare, and strange thing to see a partridge fly single; to feed always upon one dish, brings a loathing to the stomach; one swallow makes not a summer; one witness alone is of no validity in law. He that hath but one suit of clothes, and she that hath but one gown to her back, quickly wears them out. What would you do (Daughter) with this number of one? Many more inconveniences can I tell thee of this single sole number (If one may be a number.) If you be wise, be never without two; for it is a laudable and commendable company, as you may see it in yourself; who hath two ears, two feet, and two hands; two sheets upon one bed; and two smocks wherewith to shift you; and the more you have, the better it is for you; for still, (As it is in the proverb) the more Moors, the better market; and honour without profit, is no other but as a ring upon the finger.

Your accelerated, and hasty desires, not being measured by reason, make my counsels to seem better than they be. Would you, that they should yesterday, at the first word, have brought Melibea manacled, and tied to her girdle, as you would have sent into the market for any other merchandise? Wherein there is no more to do, than to go into the market, and take the pains to buy it. Sir, be of good cheer; give some ease and rest to your heart; for no great happiness can happen in an instant. It is not one stroke that can fell an oak; prepare yourself for sufferance, for wisdom is a laudable blessing; and he that is prepared, may withstand a strong encounter.</p>

All the year long she is mewed up at home, where she is daubed over with a thousand sluttish slibber-slabbers; all which (Forsooth) she must endure, for once perhaps going abroad in a twelvemonth to be seen: she anoints her face with gall and honey, with parched grapes and figs crushed and pressed together, with many other things, which for manner's sake, and reverence of the table, I omit to mention. It is their riches, that make such creatures as she to be accounted fair; it is their wealth, that causeth them to be thus commended, and not the graces, and goodly features of their bodies. For, she has such breasts, being a maid, as if she had been the mother of three children; and are for all the world, like nothing more, than two great Pompeans, or big bottled-goords. Her belly I have not seen, but judging it by the rest, I verily believe it, to be as slack, and as flaggy, as a woman of fifty year old. I know not what Calisto should see in her, that for her sake, he should forsake the love of others, whom he may with great ease obtain, and far more pleasure enjoy: unless it be, that like the palate that is distasted, he thinketh sour things the sweetest.</p>

And if natural necessity forceth them to any one of these, they are so wholly forgetful of themselves, and struck into such sudden senselessness of their present being and condition, that eating, their hands forget to carry their meat to their mouths: besides, if you talk with them, they never answer you directly. Their bodies are there with you, but where they love, there are their hearts, and their senses. Great is the force of love. His power doth not only reach over the earth, but passeth also over the seas. He holds an equal command over all mankind. He breaks thorough all kind of difficulties; and dangers whatsoever. It is a tormentful thing, full of fear, and of care. His eye rolls every way; nothing can escape him. And if any of you that be here,<pb facs="63" n="113"/> king perhaps 100. stripes upon them, and afterwards thrust them out of doors, with their hair about their cares, and their farthels at their backs, rating them in most vile manner, crying, out of my doors, you thief, you whore, you strumpet: this is no place for such paltry baggages. Thou shalt not spoil my house, I will not be thus dishonoured by thee. So that in stead of expected recompense, they receive nothing but bitter revilements. Where they expect to go preferred out of the house, they go prejudiced out of the house. And where they expect to be well married, they are quite marred in their reputation. And where they expect jewels and wedding apparel, there are they sent out naked, and disgraced: these are their rewards, these their benefits, and these the payments they receive for their service. They are bound to give them husbands, and in lieu thereof, they strip them of their clothes. The greatest grace and honour which they have in their lady's house, is to be employed in walking the streets from one lady to another, and to deliver their lady's message ▪ (As, my lady hath sent to know how you do? how you did rest tonight ? how your physic wrought with you; and how many occasions it gave your ladyship, and c?) They never hear their own name out of their ladies mouth. But the best they can call them by, is, come hither, you whore, get you gone, you drab, or I'll set you going: whither gad you now, you mangy harlotry; you pocky slut? what have you done today, you loitering quean? why did you eat this, you ravening thing, you gorbelly, you greedy cormorant? A you filthy sow, how clean this frying pan is kept? This pisspot (Minion) it is well scoured, is it not? why you lazy bones, did you not brush my clothes, when I left them off, and make clean my mantle? Why said you thus and thus, you sot, you foolish ass? Who lost the piece of plate, you scattergood, you draggletail? What's become of my handkercher, you purloining thief? you have given it to one of your copesmates, some sweetheart of yours, that must help to make you a whore: come hither, you foul flaps, say ▪ where is my hen, my crammed hen, that I cannot find her? you were best look her me out, and that quickly too, unless you mean I shall make you pay for her, when I come to pay you your wages. And besides all this, her pantofles shall walk about her ears a thousand times a day; pinchings, cudgellings, and scourgings shall be as common to her as her meat and drink. There is not any that knows how to please and content them; not any that can endure their tartness and curstness: their delight is to speak loud; their glory to chide and to brawl, and the better one does, and the more one seeks to please them, the less are they contented. And this (Mother) is the reason, why I have rather desires to live free from controlment, and to be mistress in a poor little house of mine own, than to live a slave, and at command in the richest palace of the proudest lady of them all.</p>

I tell thee, (Wench) I have seen at this table, where your kinswomen now sit, nine gallant young wenches, much about your age; for the eldest was not above eighteen, and not one of them under fourteen.

Her order is alteration; her custom, change. I cannot without tears deliver unto you the great honour I then lived in; though now, (Such is my ill fortune) by little and little, it hath gone decaying ▪ and as my days declined; so diminished and decreased my profit. It is an old saying; that whatsoever is in this world, it doth either increase or decrease. Every thing hath it's limits; every thing it's degrees of more or less: my honour did mount to that height, as was fitting for a woman of my quality to rise unto; and now of force, it must descend and fall as much: by this I know, that I am near to my end, and that the lease of my life is now expiring, and all my years are almost spent and gone: and I also well know, that I did ascend, that I might descend; that I flourished, for to wither; that I had joy, that I might have sorrow; that I was born to live; lived, to grow; grew, to grow old; and grow old to die: and though it did always appear unto me, that I ought in this respect to suffer my misery the more patiently, yet as I am formed of flesh and blood ▪ and bear this heavy mass of sin about me, I cannot but think on't now and then with grief, nor can I wholly as I would, blot every thought thereof out of the woeful role of my wretched remembrance.</p>

Besides, I needed no servants; for in keeping them, I had servants enough. Why, your noblemen, your knights, your old men, your young men, your learned men, men of all sorts and dignities, from the highest to the lowest; why, they were all at my service: and when I came to a feast, my foot was no sooner in, but I had presently as many bonnets veiled unto me, as if I had been a Duchess: he that had least acquaintance, lest business with me, was held the most vile, and basest fellow. They spying me almost a league off; they would forsake their most earnest occasions, one by one, two by two, and come to me, to see if I would command them any service; and withal, ask me severally, how his love, how his mistress did? When they saw me once pass by, you should have such a shuffling and scraping of feet, and all in such a general gaze, and so out of order, that they did neither do nor say any thing aright. One would call me mistress, another aunt, others their love, others honest old woman. There, they would consent, when they should come to my house: there they would agree when I should go unto theirs; there they would offer me money; there they would make me large promises; there likewise present me with gifts: some kissing the lappet of my coat; and some other my cheek, that by these kindnesses, they might give me contentment, and work me to their will.

For it is enough for such an old woman as I, that when a good cup of wine comes near my nose, I can be able to say, this is such a wine, or it comes from such a place, or person; why, your presents from all parts, from all sorts came upon me as thick as hops, as flies to a pot of honey, or as stones that are thrown upon a stage: boys came tumbling in at my door, with as much provision, as they could carry on their backs.

Melibea, after some exchange of words, opens her mind to Celestina; telling her how fervently she was fallen in love with Calisto. They spy Alisa, Melibea's mother coming; they take their leave each of other.

O my faithful servant, Lucrecia, what wilt thou say of me, what wilt thou think of my judgement and understanding, when thou shalt see me to publish that, which I would never discover unto thee? how wilt thou stand astonished of my honesty and modesty, which (Like a recluse, shut up from all company) I have ever hitherto kept inviolable? I know not whether thou hast suspected, or no, whence this my sorrow proceedeth, or whether thou art now coming with that solicitress of my safety? O thou high and supreme power! thou, unto whom, all that are in misery and affliction, call, and cry for help; the appassionated beg remedy, the wounded crave healing; thou, whom the heavens, seas, earth, and the centre of hell itself doth obey; thou who submittedst all things unto men, I humbly beseech thee, that thou wilt give sufferance and patience to my wounded heart, whereby I may be able to dissemble my terrible passion. Let not this leaf of my chastity lose it's gilding, which I have laid upon this amorous desire, publishing my pain to be otherwise than that, which indeed tormenteth me. But how shall I be able to do it; that poisoned morsel so cruelly tormenting me, which the sight of that gentleman's presence gave me? O sex of woman kind! feeble and frail in thy being; why was it not granted as well unto women, to discover their tormentful and fervent flames, as unto men?

For which reason I reckon your grief the less, and hold it the less dangerous; but that I may minister a wholesome medicine unto you, and such a one as may be agreeable to your disease; it is requisite, that you first satisfy me in these three particulars. The first is, on which side of your body your pain doth lie most? The second, how long you have had this pain; whether it hath taken you but of late, or<pb facs="66" n="119"/> no? For your newly growing infirmities are sooner cured in the tenderness of their growth, then when they have taken deep rooting by overlong persevering in their office: so beasts are sooner tamed when they are young, and more easily brought to the yoke, then when their hide is thoroughly hardened: so far better do those plants grow up, and prosper, which are removed when they are young and tender, than those that are transplanted, having long born fruit. The third is, whether this your evil hath proceeded of any cruel thought, which hath taken hold on you? This being made known, you shall see me set myself roundly to work about your cure; for it is very fit and convenient, that you should open the whole truth, as well to your physician, as your confessor.</p>

My pain is about my heart, it's residence, near unto my left pap; but disperseth itself over every part of my body.

O unhappy I, if by chance I had overslept myself! and my demand had depended on the answer of Sempronio, to make of eleven, ten, and of twelve, but eleven? Melibea might have come forth; I had not gone out; and she returned back: so that, neither my misery should have had an end, nor my desire have taken effect.

Mother, I have brought hither my arms all broken and battered in pieces, my buckler without it's ring of iron, the plates being cut asunder, my sword like a saw, all to be hacked and hewed, my cask strangely bruised, beaten as flat as a cake, and dented in with the blows that came hammering on my head: so that I have not any thing in the world to go further with my master, when he shall have occasion to use me.

There is a reason in all things; he hath given us a hundred crowns in gold; he hath given us, besides, a chain; three such picks more, will pick out all the wax in his ear; he hath, and will have a hard market of it.

            <p xml:id="A18331-e121510">How wittily this ass thinks he hath spoken! I swear to thee, by the reverence of this my old age, had these words been spoken after dinner, I should have said, that we had all of us taken a cup too much; that we had been all drunk. Art thou well in thy wits, Sempronio? What has thy remuneration to do with my reward? Thy payment with my merit? Am I bound to buy you weapons? Must I repair your losses, and supply your wants? Now I think upon it; let me be hanged, or die any other death, if thou hast not took hold of a little word, that carelessly slipped out of my mouth the other day, as we came along the street; for as (I remember) I then told you, that what I had was yours; and that I would never be wanting unto you in any thing, to the utmost of my poor ability; and that if fortune did prosper my business with your master, that you should lose nothing by it; but you know (Sempronio) that words of compliment and kindness, are not obligatory, nor bind me to do, as you would have me; all is not gold that glisters, for then it would be a great deal cheaper than it is. Tell me (Sempronio) if I have not hit the right nail on the head? Thou mayst see by this, that though I am old, that I can divine as much as thou canst imagine. In good faith (Son) I am as full of grief, as ever my heart can hold, I am even ready to burst with sorrow and anguish. As soon as ever I came from your house, and was come home; I gave the chain I brought hither with me, to this fool Elicia, that she might look upon it, and cheer herself with the sight thereof; and she, for her life, cannot as yet call to mind what she hath done with it: and all this livelong night, neither she nor I have slept one wink, for very thought and grief thereof: not so much for the value of the chain (For it was not much worth) but to see, that she should be so careless in the laying of it up; and to see the ill luck of it; at the very same time that we missed it, came in some friends of mine, that had been of my old and familiar acquaintance; and I am sorely afraid, lest they have lighted upon it, and taken it away with them; meaning to make use of that vulgar saying, si spy it, tum sport fac; si non spy it, pack and away Jack. But now (My sons) that I may come a little nearer unto you both, and speak home to the point: if your master gave me any thing, what he gave me, that (You must think) is mine: as for your cloth of gold doublet, I never asked you any share out of it, nor ever will. We all of us serve him, that he may give unto us all, as he sees we shall deserve: and as for that which he hath given me, I have twice endangered my life for it; more blades have I blunted in his service than you both; more material and substantial stuff have I wasted, and have worn out more hose and shoes; and you must not think (My sons) but all this costs me good money. Besides, my skill, which I got not playing or sitting still, or warming my tail over the fire, as most of your idle huswives do, but with hard labour and painstaking: as Parmeno's mother could<pb facs="79" n="145"/> well witness for me, if she were living. This I have gained by mine own industry and labour; as for you, what have you done? If you have done any thing for Calisto, Calisto is to requite you. I get my living by my trade and my travel; you, yours, with recreation and delight; and therefore you are not to expect equal recompense, enjoying your service with pleasure, as I, who go performing it with pains: but whatsoever I have hitherto said unto you, because you shall see, I will deal kindly with you: if my chain be found again, I will give each of you a pair of scarlet breeches, which is the comeliest habit that young men can wear. But if it be not found, you must accept of my good will, and myself be content to sit down with my loss; and all this I do out of pure love, because you were willing that I should have the benefit of managing this business before another: and if this will not content you, I cannot do withal. To your own harm be it.</p>

True it is, that sorrow causeth much thought; and overmuch thought, much<pb facs="81" n="149"/> hindereth sleep: as it was mine own case within these few days, when I was much discomfited and quite out of heart, of ever hoping to enjoy that surpassing happiness, which I now possess.

All will be published and come to light, whatsoever I have spoken, either to her, or them; whatsoever they knew of my doings; and whatsoever was done in this business. I dare not go forth of doors; I am ashamed to look any man in the face. O miserable young men! that ye should suffer death by so sudden a disaster. O my joys, how do you go declining, and waning from me! But it is an ancient proverb; that the higher a man climbs, the greater is his fall. Last night I gained much; today I have lost much. Your sea-calms are rare, and seldom. I might have been listed in the roll of the happy, if my fortune would but have allayed these tempestuous winds of my perdition. O fortune ▪ how much, and thorough how many parts hast thou beaten me! But howsoever thou dost shake my house, and how opposite soever thou art unto my person, yet are adversities to be endured with an equal courage: and by them, the heart is proved, whether it be of oak, or elder, strong, or weak; there is no, better say, or touchstone in the world, to know what fineness, or what characts of virtue or of fortitude remain in man. And therefore come what will come, fall back, fall edge, I will not desist to accomplish her desire, for whose sake all this hath happened. For it is better for me to pursue the benefit of that glory, which I expect, than the loss of those that are dead. They were proud, and stout, and would have been slain at some other time, if not now. The old woman was wicked and false, as it seems, in her dealings, not complying with that contract which she had made with them: so that they fell out about the true man's cloak; taking it from the true owner, to share it amongst themselves. But this was a just judgement of God upon her, that she should receive this payment, for the many adulteries, which by her intercession and means have been committed. Sosia and Tristianico shall provide themselves; they shall accompany me, in this my desired walk; they shall carry the scaling-ladders, for the walls are very high. Tomorrow I will abroad, and see if I can revenge their deaths; if not, I will purge my innocency with a feigned absence; or else feign myself mad, that I may the better enjoy this so tasteful a delight of my sweet love; as did that great captain Ulysses, to shun the Trojan war, that he might lie dulcing at home with his wife Penelope. </p>

Go get you to bed; oh wretch that I am, how suitable and natural unto me is solitariness, silence, and darkness. I know not whether the cause of it be, that there cometh now to mind, the treason that I have committed in taking my leave of that lady, whom I so dear love, before it was further day? Or whether it be the grief, which I conceive of my dishonour, by the death of my servants? Ay, i; this is it that grieves me, this is that wound whereof I bleed. Now, that I am grown a little cooler; now, that that blood waxeth cold, which yesterday did 〈◊〉 in me; now that I see the decaying of my house, my want of service, the wasting of my patrimony, and the infamy which lights upon me by the death of my servants? what have I done? How can I possibly contain myself? How can I forbear any longer, but that I should presently express myself, as a man much wronged? and show myself a proud and speedy revenger of that open ijury, which hath been offered me? O the miserable sweetness of this most short and transitory life! who is he so covetous of thy countenance, who will not rather choose to die presently, than to enjoy a whole year of a shameful life? and to prorogue it with dishonour, losing the good report and honourable memory of his noble ancestors? Especially, sithence that in this world, we have not any certain or limited time: no not so much as a moment or a minute. We are debtors without time: we stand continually bound to present payment. Why have I not gone abroad, and made all the inquiry I can, after the secret cause of my open perdition? O thou short delight of the world, how little do thy pleasure last? and how much do they cost? Repentance should not be bought so dear. O miserable that I am, when shall I recover so great a loss? what shall I do? what counsel shall I take? To whom shall I discover my disgrace? why do I conceal it from the rest of my servants and kinsfolk? They clip and note my good name in their council-house and public assembly, and make me infamous throughout the whole kingdom: and they of mine own house and kindred must not know of it; I will out amongst them. But if I go out and tell them that I was present, it is too late; if absent, it is too soon. And to provide me of friends, ancient servants, and near àllyes, it will ask some time, as likewise that we be furnished with arms, and other preparations<pb facs="86" n="158"/> of vengeance. O thou cruel judge, what ill payment hast thou made me of that my father's bread, which so often thou hast eaten? I thought, that by thy favour I might have killed a thousand men without controlment. O thou falsifier of faith, thou persecutor of the truth, thou man moulded of the baser sort of earth! Truly is the proverb verified in thee; that for want of good men thou wast made a judge. Thou shouldst have considered, that thyself, and those thou didst put to death, were servants to my ancestors and me, and thy fellows and companions. But when the base to riches doth ascend, he regardeth neither kindred nor friend. Who would have thought, that thou wouldst have wrought my undoing? But there is nothing more hurtful, than an unexpected enemy. Why wouldst thou that it should be verified of thee, that that which came out of Aetna, should consume Aetna? And that I hatched the crow, which picked out mine eyes? Thou thyself art a public delinquent, and yet punishest those that were private offenders. But I would have thee to know; that a private fault is less than a public, and less the inconvenience and danger: at least, according to the laws of Athens, which were not written in blood, but do show that it is a less error, not to condemn a delinquent, than to punish the innocent. O how hard a matter is it, to follow a just cause before an unjust judge! How much more this excess of my servants, which was not free from offence! But consider with all spite of all stoical paradox, their guilt was not equal, though their sufferings alike. What deserved the one, for that which the other did? That only because he was his companion, thou shouldst doom them both to death? But why do I talk thus? With whom do I discourse? Am I in my right wits? What's the matter with thee, Calisto? Dreamest thou, sleepest thou, or wakest thou? Standest thou on thy feet? Or liest thou all along? Consider with thyself that thou art in thy chamber. Dost thou not see that the offendor is not present? With whom dost thou contend? Come again to thyself; weigh with thyself, that the absent were never found just. But if thou wilt be upright in thy judgement, thou must keep an ear for either party. Dost thou not see, that the law is supposed to be equal unto all? Remember that Romulus, the first founder of Rome, killed his own brother, because he transgressed the law. Consider that Torquatus the Roman slew his own son, because he exceeded his commission. And many other like unto these did this man do. Think likewise with thyself, that if the judge were here present, he would make thee this answer; that the principal and the accessary, the actor and consenter, do merit equal punishment. Howbeit, they were both notwithstanding executed, for that which was committed but by one. And if that other had not his pardon, but received a speedy judgement, it was, because the fault was notorious, and needed no further proofs: as also that they were taken in the very<pb facs="86" n="159"/> act of murder, and that one of them was found dead of his fall from the window. And it is likewise to be imagined, that that weeping wench which Celestina kept in her house, made them to hasten the more by her woeful and lamentable noise: and that the judge, that he might not make a hurly-burly of it, that he might not defame me, and that he might not stay till the people should press together, and hear the proclaiming of that great infamy, which could not choose but follow me, he did sentence them so early as he did; and the common hangman, which was the crier, could do no otherwise, that he might comply with their execution and his own discharge. All which, if it were done as I conceive it to be, I ought rather to rest his debtor, and think myself bound unto him the longest day of my life, not as to my father's sometimes servant, but as to my true and natural brother. But put case it were not so; or suppose I should not conster it in the better sense, yet call, Calisto, to mind the great joy and solace thou hast had, bethink thyself of thy sweet lady and mistress, and thy whole and sole happiness: and since for her sake thou esteemest thy life as nothing for to do her service, thou art not to make any reckoning of the death of others: and the rather, because no sorrow can equal thy received pleasure. O my lady and my life, that I should ever think to offend thee in thy absence! And yet in doing as I do, methinks , it argues against me, that I hold in small esteem that great and singular favour, which I have received at thy hands. I will now no longer think on grief; I will no longer entertain friendship with sorrow. O incomparable good! O insatiable contentment! And what could I have asked more of heaven, in requital of all my merits in this life (If they be any) than that which I have already received? Why should I not consent myself with so great a blessing? which being so, it stands not with reason that I should be ungrateful unto him, who hath conferred upon me so great a good: I will therefore acknowledge it, I will not with care craze my understanding, lest that being lost, I should fall from so high and so glorious a possession. I desire no other honour, no other glory, no other riches, no other father nor mother, no other friends nor kinsfolks. In the day, I will abide in my chamber: in the night, in that sweet paradise, in that pleasant grove, that green plot of ground amid those sweet trees and fresh and delightsome walks. O night of sweet rest and quiet! O that thou hadst made thy return! O bright shining Phoebus, drive on thy chariot apace, make haste to thy journey's end. O comfortable and delightful stars, break your wont, and appear before your time, and out of your wonted and continued course! O dull and slow clock, I wish to see thee burned in the quickest and loveliest fire that love can make. For didst thou but expect that which I do, when thou strikest twelve, thou wouldst never endure to be tied to the will of the master that made thee! O ye hiemetical<pb facs="87" n="160"/> and winterly months, which now hide your heads, and live in darkness and obscurity! Why haste ye not to cut off these tedious days with your longer nights? Methinks , it is almost a year, since I saw that sweet comfort and most delightful refreshing of my travels. But what do I ask? Why like a fool do I, out of impatiency desire that which never either was or shall be? For your natural courses did never learn to wheel away. For to all of them there is an equal course, to all of them one and the selfsame space and time. Not so much as to life and death, but there is a settled and limited end. The secret motions of the high firmament of heaven, of the planets and the north-star, and of the increase and wane of the moon, all of these are ruled with an equal rein, all of these are moved with an equal spur. Heaven, earth, sea, fire, wind, heat and cold. What will it benefit me, that this clock of iron should strike twelve, if that of heaven do not hammer with it? And therefore though I rise never so soon, it will never the sooner be day. But thou my sweet imagination, thou, who canst only help me in this case, bring thou unto my fantasy the unparalleled presence of that glorious image. 'cause thou to come unto my ears that sweet music of her words, those her unwilling hangings off without profit, that her pretty, I prithee leave off; forbear, good sir, if you love me; touch me not; do not deal so discourteously with me. Out of whose ruddy lips, methinks , I hear these words still sound, do not seek my undoing: which she would evermore be out withal. Besides, those her amorous embracements betwixt every word; that her losing of herself from me; and clipping me again; that her flying from me and her coming to me; those her sweet sugared kisses; and that her last salutation wherewith she took her leave of me. O with what pain did it issue from her mouth! with what resuscitation of her spirits! with how many tears, which did seem to be so many round pearls, which did fall without any noise from her clear and resplendent eyes!</p>

And you likewise saw how Celestina, at the intercession of Sempronio, so as she might be paid for her pains, undertook the charge of that business, and to be the means to effect it for him; wherein she used such diligence, and was so careful in the following of it, that she drew water at the second spitting. Now when Calisto saw so good and so quick a dispatch, which he never hoped to have effected, amongst divers other things, he gave this my unfortunate aunt a chain of gold. And as it is the nature of that metal, that the more we drink thereof, the more we thirst; she, when she saw herself so rich, appropriated the whole gain to herself, and would not let Sempronio and Parmeno have their parts, it being before agreed upon between them, that whatsoever Calisto gave her, they should share it alike. Now, they being come home weary one morning from accompanying their master, with whom they had been abroad all night, being in great choler and heat, upon I know not what quarrels and brawls, (As they themselves said) that had betided them, they demanded part of the chain of Celestina, for to relieve themselves therewith. She stood upon denial of any such covenant or promise made between them; affirming the whole gain to be due to her; and discovering withal other petty matters of some secrecy. For, (As it in the proverb) when gossips brawl, than out goes all. So that they being mightily enraged, on the one side necessity did urge them, which rends and breaks all the love in the world; on the other side, the great anger and weariness they brought thither with them, which many times works an alteration in us. And besides, they saw that they were forsaken in their fairest hopes, she breaking her faith and promise with them: so that they knew not in the world what to do; and so continued a great while upon terms with her, some hard words passing to and fro between them. But in the end perceiving her covetous disposition, and finding that she still persevered in her denial, they laid hands upon their swords, and hacked and hewed her in a thousand pieces.</p>

And that which grieves me most, is, to see that for all this, that villain Calisto, who hath no sense, nor feeling of his servant's deaths, goes every night to see and visit his filth Melibea, feasting and solacing himself in her company, whilst she grows proud, glorying to see so much blood to be sacrificed to her service.</p>

O! how quickly the villain would fat himself with joy, and how happy would he hold himself, if I would but impose any service upon him! for he went away from me very sad and heavy, to see how coursely I used him: and should I but now send for him again, and speak kindly unto him, he would think himself taken up in some strange sweet rapture; so much will he be ravished with joy.

As for the rest that remain behind, leave that to me; I will take order for Calisto and Melibea; and I shall give them as bitter a potion to drink, as they have given thee.

We are now (According to the course of nature) to be shortly under his banner; this we may plainly perceive, if we will but he hold our equals,<pb facs="91" n="169"/> our brothers and our kinsfolk round about us; the grave hath devoured them all; they are all brought to their last home.

Let us therefore prepare ourselves, and pack up our farthels, for to go this enforced journey which cannot be avoided. Let not that cruel and doleful sounding trumpet of death, summon us away on the sudden and unprovided. Let us prepare ourselves, and set them in order whilst we have time, for it is better to prevent, than to be prevented; let us confer our substance on our sweet successor; let us couple our only daughter to a husband, such a one as may suit with our estate, that we may go quietly and contentedly out of this world. The which with much diligence and carefulness, we ought from henceforth to endeavour and put in execution: and what we have at other times commenced in this matter, we ought now to consummate it. I would not by our negligence have our daughter in guardians hands; I like not she should be a ward; she is not fit for marriage, and therefore much better for her to be in a house of her own, then in ours: by which means we shall free her from the tongues of the vulgar; for there is no virtue so absolute and so perfect, which hath not her detracting and foul-mouthed slanderers; neither is there any thing, whereby a virgin's good name is kept more pure and unsported, then by a mature and timely marriage. Who in all this city will refuse our alliance? who will not be glad to enjoy such a jewel, in whom those four principal things concur, which are demanded and desired in marriage? The first, discretion, honesty and virginity. The second, beauty. The third, noble birth and parentage. The last, riches. With all these nature hath endowed her.

I know not whether they have had any inkling of our meeting? or whether they have overheard us? nor can I devise in the world, what should be the reason, why they should be so hot upon the matter, and more eager for the marrying of me now, then ever heretofore: but they shall miss of their purpose; they shall labour it in vain: for to what use serves the clapper in the mill, if the miller be deaf? Who is he that can remove me from my glory? Who can withdraw me from my pleasure? Calisto is my soul, my life, my lord; on whom I have set up my rest, and in whom I have placed all my hopes; I know that in him I cannot be deceived. And since that he loves me, with what other thing but love can I requite him? All the debts in the world receive their payment in a divers kind; but love admits no other payment, but love. I glad myself in thinking on him; I delight myself in seeing him; and rejoice myself in hearing him. Let him do with me what he will, and dispose of me at his pleasure; if he will go to sea, I will go with him; if he will round the world, I will along with him; if he will sell me for a slave in the enemy's country, I will not resist his desire. Let my parents let me enjoy him, if they mean to enjoy me; let them not settle their thoughts upon these vanities, nor think no more upon those their marriages. For, it is better to be well beloved, then ill married; and a good friend is better than a bad husband. Let them suffer me to enjoy the pleasure of my youth, if they mind to enjoy any quietness in their age; if not, they will but prepare destruction for me, and for themselves a sepulchre. I grieve for nothing more, than for the time that I have lost in not enjoying him any sooner, and that he did not know me, as soon as he was known unto me. I will no husband; I will not fully the knots of matrimony, nor tread against the matrimonial steps of another man; nor walk in the way of wedlock with a stranger, as I find many have done, in those ancient books which I have read, which were far more discreet, and wiser than myself; and more noble in their estate and lineage, whereof some were held among the heathens for goddesses: as was Venus, the<pb facs="92" n="171"/> mother of Aeneas and of Cupid, the god of love, who being married, broke her plighted troth of wedlock: as likewise divers others, who were inflamed with a greater fire, and did commit most nefarious and incestuous errors: as Myrrha, with her father; Semiramis with her son; Canace with her brother; others also in a more cruel and beastly fashion, did transgress the law of nature: as Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos, with a bull: and these were Queens and great ladies, under whose faults (Considering the foulness of them) mine may pass as reasonable, without note of shame, or dishonesty. My love was grounded upon a good and just cause, and a far more lawful ground. I was wooed and sued unto, and captivated by Calisto's good deserts; being thereunto solicited by that subtle and cunning mistress in her art, dame Celestina, who adventured herself in many a dangerous visit, before that ever I would yield myself true prisoner to his love. And now for this month, and more (As you yourself have seen) he hath not failed, no, not so much as one night, but hath still scaled our garden walls, as if he had come to the scaling of a fort; and many times hath been repulsed, and assaulted it in vain, being driven to withdraw his siege. And yet for all this, he continued more constant and resolute still, and never would give over, as one that thought his labour to be well bestowed. For my sake, his servants have been slain; for my sake, he hath wasted and consumed his substance; for my sake he hath feigned absence with all his friends in the city; and all day long he hath had the patience to remain close prisoner in his own house, and only upon hope (Wherein he counted himself happy) to see me in the night: far, far therefore from me be all ingratitude; far be all flattery and dissimulation towards so true and faithful a lover; for I regard (In my regard to him) neither husband, father, nor kindred; for in losing my Calisto, I lose my life, which life of mine doth therefore please me, because it pleaseth him; which I desire no longer to enjoy, than he shall joy in it.</p>

I can hear no music nor stirring betimes in the morning; I have no amorous ditties sung by my lovers at my window; there are no frays, nor quarrels before my door; they do not cut and slash one another a-nights for my sake, as they were wont to do: and that which most of all grieves me, is, that I see neither penny nor farthing, nor any other present to come within my doors. But for this, can I blame nobody but myself; myself only is in fault; for had I followed the counsel of her, who is my true and faithful sister, whenas I brought her the other day the news of this sad and heavy accident, which hath brought all this penury upon me, I had not lived alone mured up between two walls; nor others loathed to have come, and seen me. The devil (I think) makes me to mourn thus for him, who, had I been dead, would scarce, perhaps, have shed one tear for me. Now I dare boldly say, that Areusa told me truth. Sister (Quoth she) never conceive, nor show more sorrow for the misfortune, or death of another, than he would have done for thee. Sempronio, had I been dead, would have been ne'er a whit the less merry, he would not have wronged-his delights, nor abridged his pleasures. And why then like a fool should I grieve and vex myself, for one that is dead and gone, and hath lost his head by order of law? And what can I tell, whether being a choleric and hastly-harebrained fellow as he was, he might have killed me too, as well as he did that old woman, whom I reckoned of as of mine own mother? I will therefore by all means follow Arcusa's counsel, who knows more of the world than I do; and go new and then to visit her, that I may learn something from her, how I may live another day. O what a sweet participation will this be? what a delightful conversation? I see it is not said in vain; that of more worth is one day of a wise man, than the whole life of a fool; I will therefore put off my mourning weeds, lay aside my sorrow, dismiss my tears, which have hitherto been so ready to offer their service to my eyes. But sithence that it is the very first office that we do, as soon as we are born, to come crying into the world; I nothing wonder that it is so easy to begin to cry; and so hard to leave off. But this may teach one wit, by seeing the hurt it does to the eyes; by seeing that good clothes and neat dressings, make a woman seem ●●ire and handsome, though she be nothing so, nor so; making her of old, young; and of young, younger. Your coloured paintings,<pb facs="94" n="174"/> and your cerusses which give women such a pure white and red, what are they, but a slimy clinging thing, a kind of birdlime, wherewith men are taken and ensnared? Come then thou my glass, come hither again unto me; and thou to my antimonium; for I have too much already wronged my eyes, and almost marred my face, with my blubbering and weeping. I will on with my white veils, my wrought gorgets, my gay garments, my more pleasing attire, and such other apparel, as shall speak pleasure. I will presently provide some lie for my hair, which now through neglect, hath lost it's bright burnished hue. And this being done, I will count my hens, I will make up my bed: for it glads a woman's heart, to see things neat and handsome about her. I will have all well swept and made clean before my door, and the street that butts upon it, sprinkled with water, as well to keep it cool, as to lay the dust; to the end, that they who pass by, may plainly thereby perceive, that I have banished all grief, and shaken hands with sorrow. But first of all, I will go and visit my cousin, to know whether Sosia have been with her or no? And what good she hath done upon him? For I have not seen him; since I told him that Areusa would fain speak with him. I pray Jove, I may find her all alone; for she is seldom any more without gallants, than a good tavern is without drunkards; the door is shut, there should be nobody within; I will knock, and see.

And as it is in the proverb, he that loves Beltram, loves any thing that is his; all his friends were always welcome unto me; his good service to his master did as much please me, as it pleased himself. When he saw any harm towards Calisto, he did study to prevent it. Now as all this is true, so thought I it good to acquaint thee with it. First then did I send for thee, that I might give thee to understand how much I love thee; and how much I joy and ever shall, in this thy visiting me; nor shalt thou lose any thing by it, if I can help it, but rather turn to thy profit and benefit. Secondly, since that I have settled my eyes, my love and affection on thee, that I may advise thee to take heed how thou comest in danger; and besides, to admonish thee, that thou do not discover thy secrers to any: for you see what ill befell Parmeno and Sempronio, by imparting things of secrecy unto Celestina; for I would not willingly see thee die in such an ill fashion, as your fellow and companion did; it is enough for me that I have bewailed one of you already, and therefore I would have you to know, that there came one unto me, and told me that you had discovered unto him the love, that is betwixt Calisto and Melibea; and how he won her; and how you yourself night by night went along with him; and many other things which now I cannot call to mind. Take heed (Friend) for not to keep a secret, is proper only unto women, yet not unto all, but such as are fools and children. Take heed (I say) for here-hence great hurt may come unto you: and to this end did nature give you two ears, and two eyes, and but one tongue; to the end that what you see and hear, should be double to that you speak. Take heed, and do not think your friend will keep your secret, when you yourself cannot keep it; when therefore thou art to go with thy master, Calisto, to that lady's house, make no noise, lest you be heard; for some have told me, that every night you keep a coil, and cannot contain yourselves, as men transported and overjoyed.</p>

And Calisto is not so mad, or foolish, that at such an hour as that, he should go about a business of so great a consequence, but that he will first be sure that all abroad is quiet, and that every man reposes himself in the sweetness of his first sleep: and less are you to suppose, that he should go every night unto her; for such a duty will not endure a daily visitation.

But omitting many other speeches of good counsel, which then passed between us, she made present show unto me, that she was now as much mine, as ever she was Parmeno's. She requested me, that I would continually come and visit her; and that she did not doubt, but that she should long enjoy my love. And I swear to thee (Brother) by that dangerous way wherein we walk, and as ever any good may hereafter befall me, that twice or thrice it was as much as ever I could do for my life, to forbear from boarding her; but that very shame did hinder me, seeing her so fair, and so well clad, and myself in an old mouse-eaten cloak: still as she moved and advanced herself, she did breathe forth a most sweet and redolent odour of musk; and I never stirred, or heaved my body, but I sent forth a most rank sent of that horse-dung, which had got within my shoes: she had a hand as white as snow, and ever and anon, as she pulled off her glove, thou wouldst have thought, that she had scattered flowers of oranges about the room; so that as well in regard of this, as also because at that time she was somewhat busy, I was content to defer my boldness till another day: as likewise because all things at the first sight are not so tractable; for the more they are communicated, the better are they understood in their participation.</p>

This woman, (As you told me yourself) is a known and a noted whore; and therefore whatsoever hath passed between you, flatter not yourself, but rather believe, that her words do not want deceit. Her offers, I<pb facs="99" n="185"/> persuade me were false, though I know not to what end she made them. If she love thee, because thou art a gentleman; how many better than thyself hath she rejected? If because thou art rich; she knows well enough that thou hast no other dust, then that which clings to the currycomb. If because thou art nobly descended, and of high lineage; she knows thy name is Sosia, and so was thy fathers; and that he was born and bred in a poor little hamlet, getting his living by following the ploughtail, and breaking clods of earth, for which thyself art more fit than to make a lover. Be wise, Sosia, and consider with thyself, if she do not go a bir●ing, to see if she could get out of thee, the secrecy of this walk, whereby to work some heartburning, and breed no good blood betwixt Calisto and Pleberio, out of that envy which she bears to Melibea's pleasure. Beware (I say:) for envy (I tell you) is an incurable infirmity, when it is once settled: she is a guest that is always more troublesome, then thankful for her lodging, and is never merry, but at other folks miseries; nor ever laughs, but at a shrewd turn. Now then, if this be so: o! how this wicked woman will deceive thee with her smooth and subtle words, whereof, such as she are never to seek, but have them still ready in the deck, and more perfect than their pater noster? With this venomous vice, she will not stick to damn her soul, so as she may please her appetite; she would fain turn all things topsy-turvy, and set men together by the ears, and only for to content her damnable desire. O ruffianly strumpet! O mankind quean! With what white bread hath she given thee crooked pins, to choke thee? She cares not now she sells and barters her body, so as she may truck and exchange it for strife and contention. Hear me, Sosia, and if thou dost as thou mayest presume upon it, that it is as I tell thee, deal (If thou wilt be advised by me) as doubly with her; for he that deceives the deceiver, you know what I mean: and if the fox be crafty, more crafty is he that catches him. I would have thee make a countermine against these her wicked, and devilish imaginations. Set up scaling ladders to meet with her lewdness; and then cry quittance with her, when she thinks herself most safe and secure; and laugh at her afterwards, when thou art by thyself all alone in thy stable: the bay horse thinks one thing, and he that saddles him, another.</p>

Why didst thou suffer me to send forth my words into the air, senseless and foolish as they were, and in this hoarse swannish voice of mine? look on the moon, and see how bright she shines upon us: look on the clouds, and see how speedily they rack away: harken to the gurgling waters of this fountain: how sweet a murmur, and what a pretty kind of purling they make, rushing along these fresh herbs, and pleasant flowers: harken to these high cypresses, how one bough makes peace with another by the intercession of a mild, gentle, and temperate wind, which moves them to and fro. Behold these silent and quiet shades, how dark they are, and how excellently well prepared for the covering and concealing of our sports.

Why do not you forget these tricks, and learn to leave them? Lay your command upon them to be quiet, and will them to lay aside this offensive custom, and consider (My dearest) that as to see thee, whilst thou carriest thyself quietly and civilly, is the greatest happiness that either my heart or my eye can enjoy; so is it as displeasing unto me, to see thee handle me so roughly. Thy honest sporting pleaseth me, but thy dishonest hands offend me, especially when they are too far out of reason. And, though love oft-times forget reason, yet amongst your well-educated, and noble and generous spirits, kindness keeps a decorum, and revels not but with decency; let such (Sweetheart) be our embraces, such and so modest be our dalliance (My dearest Calisto, my love, my lord.) And since I wholly subject myself to your pleasure; be it your pleasure, to take and make such worthy benefit of my affection, presence and service, as best beseems true lovers, and is agreeable to both our high births and breeding.

The manner of my death falls fit and pat to my mind; it is some ease unto me, that I and my beloved Calisto shall so soon meet again. I will shut and make fast the door, that nobody may come up to hinder my death, nor disturb my departure, nor to stop me in my journey, wherein I purpose to post unto him; not doubting, but to visit him as well this very day, as he did me this last night. All things fadge aright, and have fallen out as luckily, as I could wish it; I shall now have time and leisure enough, to recount to my father Pleberio, the cause of this my short and sudden end. I confess, I shall much wrong his silver hairs, and offer much injury to his elder years; I shall work great woe unto him by this my error; I shall leave him in great heaviness and desolation all the days of his life: but admit my death will be the death of my dearest parents, and put case, that the shortening of my days, will be the shortening of theirs; who doth not know, but that others have been more cruel to their parents then I am? Prusias, King of Bythinia, without any cause, not enduring that pain, which I do, slew his own father Ptolemy, King of Egypt, slew both father and mother, and brother and wife, and all for the love of his mistress. Orestes killed his mother, Clytaemnestra, and that cruel emperor Nero, only for the fulfilling of his pleasure, murdered his own mother. These, and such as they, are worthy of blame. These are true parricides; not I; who with mine own punishment, and with mine own death, purge away the guilt, which otherwise, they might more justly lay upon me for their deaths. There have been others,<pb facs="104" n="294"/> far more cruel, who have slain their own children, and their own brothers, in comparison of whose errors, mine is as nothing; at least nothing so great. Philip, King of Macedon; Herod, King of Jewry; Constantine, emperor of Rome; Laodice, Queen of Cappadocea; and Medea the sorceress; all these slew their own sons and dearest children, and that without any reason or just cause, preserving their own persons still in safety. To conclude, that great cruelty of phr●ates, King of the Parthians, occurs to my remembrance, who, because he would have no successor behind him, murdered Orodes, his aged father, as also his only son, besides some thirty more of his brothers. These were delicts worthy blame indeed; because they keeping their own persons free from peril, butchered their ancestors, their successors, and their brothers. True it is, that though all this be so, yet are we not to imitate them in those things wherein they did amiss; but it is not in my power to do otherwise. And thou great governor of the heavens, who art witness to my words, thou seest the small power that I have over my passion; thou seest how my liberty is captivated, and how my senses are taken with that powerful love of that late deceased gentleman, who hath deprived me of that love, which I bear to my living parents.</p>

Now, by and by shalt thou be suddenly wounded; thy heart shall presently be pricked with grief, and shall bleed abundantly, to see the death of thy only daughter. My end draws near; at hand is my, rest, and thy passion ▪ my ease, and thy pain; my hour of keeping company and thy time of solitariness. You shall not need (My most honoured father) to seek out any instruments of music to assuage my sorrow; nor use any other sound, save the sound of bells, for to ring my knell, and bring my body to the grave. And, if thou canst hearken unto me for tears, if thine eyes will give thine cares leave to hear, thou shalt hear the desperate cause of this my forced, yet joyful departure; see thou neither speak nor weep; interrupt me not, either with tears or words, unless thou meanest more hereafter to be tormented, in not knowing why I do kill myself, than thou art now sorrowful to see my death. Neither ask, nor answer me any thing; nor question me any further, then what of mine own accord I shall willingly tell thee; for when the heart is surcharged with sorrow, the ear is deaf to good counsel; and at such a time, good and wholesome words rather incense, then allay rage. Hear (My aged father) the last words that ever I shall speak unto you. And if you entertain them, as I hope you will, you will rather excuse, then condemn my error. I am sure, you both well<pb facs="104" n="195"/> perceive and hear that most sad and doleful lamentation, which is made throughout all this city; I am sure you hear this great noise and ringing of bells, the skriking and cryings out of all sorts of people, this howling, and barking of dogs, this noise and clattering of armour. Of all this, have I been the cause; ay, even this very day, have clothed the greater part of the knights, and gentlemen of this city in mourning. Ay, even this very day, have left many servants orphaned, and quite destitute of a master. I have been the cause, that many a poor soul hath now lost it's alms and relief. I have been the occasion, that the dead should have the company of the most complete gentleman, for his good graces and qualities that ever was born. I have been the occasion, that the living have lost the only pattern and paragon of courtesy, of gallant inventions, of witty devices, of neatness and decency in his clothes, of speech, of gate, of kindness, and of virtue. I have been the occasion, that the earth doth now enjoy the most noble body, and the freshest flower of youth, that ever was created in this age of ours. And because you may stand amazed and astonished at the sound of these my unusual and unaccustomed crimes; I will open the business, and make this matter appear more clear unto you.</p>
            <p xml:id="A18331-e127250">It is now (Dear father) many days since that a gentleman called Calisto, whom you well known, as likewise his ancestors, and noble lineage, did languish and pine away for my love. As for his virtues and goodness, they were generally known to the whole world. So great was his love-torment, and so little both place and opportunity to speak with me, that he was driven to discover his passion to a crafty and subtle woman, named Celestina, which Celestina, coming as a suitor unto me in his behalf, drew my secret love from forth my bosom, and made me to manifest that unto her, which I concealed from mine own mother; she found the means to win me to her will; she made the match between us; she plotted how his desire and mine should take effect. And if he dear loved me, I was not therein deceived; she made up that sad conclusion of that sweet and unfortunate execution of his will; and thus being overcome with the love of Calisto, I gave him entrance into your house; he scaled your walls with ladders, and broke into your garden; broke my chaste purpose, by taking from me the flower of my virginity. And thus almost this month have we lived in this delightful error of love. And as he came this lastnight unto me, as he was wont to do, e'en just about the time that he should have returned home (As ill fortune would have it, who in the mutability of her nature, ordereth and disposeth all things, according to her disordered custom) the walls being high, the night dark, the ladder light and weak, his servants that brought it, unacquainted with that kind of service, he going down somewhat hastily to see a fray, which he heard in the street between his servants and some others that then passed by, being in choler, making more haste<pb facs="105" n="196"/> than good speed, thinking he should never come soon enough, not eyeing well his steps, he sets his foot quite besides the rounds, and so fell down, and with that woeful and unfortunate fall, he pitched upon his head, and had his brains beaten out, and dashed in pieces against the stones and pavement of the street. Thus did the destinies cut off his thread; thus cut off his life without confession; cut off my hope; cut off my glory; cut off my company. Things therefore being thus; tell me (Father) what cruelty were it in me, he dying disbrained, that I should live pained all the days of my life? His death inviteth mine; inviteth? nay, enforceth me, that it be speedily effected, and without delay; it teacheth me, that I should also fall headlong down, that I may imitate him in all things. It shall not be said of me, that those that are dead and gone, are soon forgotten. And therefore I will seek to content him in my death, since I had not time to give him content in my life. O my love, and dear lord, Calisto, expect me, for now I come. But stay a little, though thou dost expect me; and be not angry, I prithee, that I delay thee, being that I am now paying my last debt, and giving it my final account to my aged father, to whom I owe much more. O my best beloved father, I beseech you, if ever you did love me in this painful forepast life, that we may both be interred in one tomb, and both our obsequies be solemnised together. I would fain speak some words of comfort unto you, before this my gladsome and well-pleasing end, gathered and collected out of those ancient books, which for the bettering of my wit and understanding, you willed me to read, were it not that my memory fails me, being troubled and disquieted with the loss and death of my love: as also because I see your ill endured tears trickle so fast down your wrinkled cheeks. Recommend me to my most dear and best-beloved mother; and do you inform her at large of the doleful occasion of my death. I am glad with all my heart, that she is not here present with you; for her sight would but increase my sorrow. Take (Aged father) the gifts of old age; for in large days, large griefs are to be endured. Receive the pledge and earnest of thy reverend age; receive it at the hands of thy beloved daughter. I sorrow much for myself, more for you, but most for my aged mother: and so I recommend me to you both, and both of you unto your more happiness, to whom I offer up my soul; leaving the care to you, to cover this body that is now coming down unto you.</p>

Our solace is in the suds; our joy is turned into annoy; all our conceived hopes are utterly lost; all our happiness is quite overthrown; let us now no longer desire to live. And because unexpected sorrows leave a greater impression of grief; and because they may bring<pb facs="106" n="198"/> thee the sooner to thy grave; as also, that I may not alone by myself bewail that heavy loss which belongs to us both; look out and behold her, whom thou broughtest forth, and I begotten, dashed and broken all to pieces. The cause I understood from herself, but laid open more at large, by this her sad and sorrowful servant. Help to lament these our latter days, which are now growing to an end. O ye good people, who come to behold my sorrows, and you gentlemen, my loving friends, do you also assist to bewail my misery! O my daughter! and my only good! it were cruelty in me, that I should outlive thee. My threescore years were fitter for the grave, than thy twenty; but the order of my dying was altered by that extremity of grief, which did hasten thy end. O ye my boary hairs, grown forth to no other end, save sorrow; it would better have suited with you, to have been buried in the earth, then with these golden tresses which lie here before me. Too too many are the days that I have yet to live; I will complain and cry out against death; I will accuse him of delay; how long will he suffer me to remain here after thee! Let my life now leave me, since I must leave thy sweet company. O my dear wife, rise up from her, and if any life be left in thee, spend that little with me in tears and lamentations, in sobs, and in sighs; but in case thy soul resteth now with hers; if out of very grief, thou hast left this life, why wouldst thou lay this heavy burden on me? why let me remain here alone, and have nobody to help me in the unsheathing of my sorrows? In this, ye women have a great advantage of us that are men; for some violent grief can make you go out of the world without any pain; or at least cast you into a swoon, which is some ease to your sorrows. O the hard heart of a father, why dost thou not burst with grief? why do not your heartstrings crack in sunder, to see thyself bereaved of thy beloved heir? For whom didst thou build these turrets? For whom got I honours? For whom planted trees? For whom built ships? O hard-hearted earth, why dost thou bear me any longer? Where shall my disconsolate old age find any resting place? O variable fortune, and full of change, thou ministress, and high stewardess of all temporal happiness; why didst thou not execute thy cruel anger upon me? Why didst thou not overwhelm him with thy mutable waves, who professes himself to be thy subject? Why didst thou not rob me of my patrimony? Why didst thou not set fire on my house? Why didst thou not lay waste mine inheritance? Why didst thou not strip me of my great revenues? What is't I would not thou shouldst have done, so as thou hadst left me that flourishing young plant, over which thou ought'st not to have had such power? Thou mightst, oh fortune (Fluctuant, and fluent as thou art) have given me a sorrowful youth, and a mirthful age; neither have therein perverted order. Better could I have born thy blow, better endured thy persecutions, in that my more strong, and oaky<pb facs="106" n="199"/> age, then in this my weak and feeble declining. O life fulfilled with grief, and accompanied with naught but misery! O world, world! much have men spoken of thee, much have men writ concerning thy deceits; and much have I heard myself: and mine own woeful experience is able to say something of thee, as one who have been in the unfortunate fair, and have often bought and sold with thee, but never had any thing that succeeded happily with me. As one who many a time heretofore, even to this present hour, have silenced thy false properties, and all because I would not purchase thy displeasure, and pull thy hatred upon me: and that thou shouldst not untimely pluck this flower from me, which this day thou hast cropped by the mightiness of thy power. And therefore now will I go without fear, like one that hath nothing to lose; or as one to whom thy company is now odious and troublesome; or like a poor traveller, who fearless of thieves, goes singing on his way. I thought in my more tender years, that both thou and thy actions were governed by order, and ruled by reason: but now I see thou art pro and con; there is no certainty in thy calms: thou seemest now unto me to be a labyrinth of errors; a fearful wilderness; an habitation of wild beasts; a dance full of changes; a fen full of mire, and dirt; a country full of thorns; a steep and craggy mountain, a field full of stones; a meadow full of snakes and serpents; a pleasant garden to look to, but without any fruit; a fountain of cares, a river of tears, a sea of miseries; trouble without profit; a sweet poison, a vain hope, a false joy, and a true sorrow. O thou false world! thou dost cast before us the baits of thy best delights, and when we have swallowed them, they seeming savoury unto us, then dost thou show us the hook that must choke us. Nor can we avoid it, because together with us, thou dost captivate our wills: thou promisest mountains, but performest molehills: and than thou dost cast us off, that we may not put thee in mind of making good thy vain promises. We run thorough the spacious fields of thy rank vices, retchless, and with a loose rein; and then dost thou discover thy ambushes unto us, when thou seest there is no way forus to retreat. Many have forsaken thee, fearing thy sudden forsaking of them. And well may they style themselves happy, when they shall see, how well thou hast rewarded this poor heavy sorrowful old man, for his long service. Thou dost put out our eyes, and then to make us amends, thou anointest the place with oil: thou breakest our head, and givest us a plaster; after thou hast done us a great deal of harm, thou givest us a poor cold comfort; thou dost hurt unto all, that no man may boast, that others have not their crosses as well as we; telling them, that it is some ease to the miserable, to have companions in their misery. But I alas, disconsolate old man stand all alone. I am singular in my sorrows; I am grieved, and have no equal companion of my grief. No man's misfortune is like unto mine; though I revolve in my<pb facs="107" n="200"/> troubled memory, persons both present and past, I cannot instance in the like. If I shall seek to comfort myself with the severity and patience of Paulus Aemilius, who having lost two sons in seven days, bore this brunt of fortune with so undaunted a courage, that the people of Rome had rather need to be comforted by him, than he by them; yet cannot this satisfy me, for he had two more remaining that were his adopted sons. What companion then will they allot me of my misery? Pericles, that brave Athenian captain? or valiant Xenophon? Tush, they lost sons indeed, but their sons died out of their sight, having lost their lives abroad in foreign countries, far from home; so that it was not much for the one, not to change countenance, but to take it cheerfully: nor for the other to answer the messenger, who brought him the ill tidings of his son's deaths, that he should receive no punishment, because himself had received no grief; for all this is far differing from mine; less canst thou say (Thou world replenished with evil) that Anaxagoras, and I, were alike in our loss; that we were equal in our griefs: and that I should say of my dead daughter, as he did of his only son, when he said; being that I was mortal, I knew, that he whom I had begotten was to die. For my Melibea, willingly, and out of her own election, killed herself before mine eyes, enforced thereunto through the extreme passion of her love, so great was her torment; whereas his son was slain in battle, in a just and lawful war. O incomparable loss; oh most wretched and sorrowful old man that I am! who the more I seek after comfort, the less reason do I find for my comfort; for much more miserable do I find my misfortune, and do not so much grieve at her death, as I do lament the manner of her death. Now shall I lose together with thee (Most unhappy daughter) those fears, which were daily wont to affright me. Only thy death is that which makes me secure of all suspicions and jealousies. What shall I do, when I shall come into thy chamber, and thy withdrawing room, and shall find it solitary and empty? What shall I do, whenas I shall call thee, and thou shalt not answer me? Who is he that can supply that want which thou hast caused? Who can stop up that great breach in my heart which thou hast made? Never any man did lose that which I have lost this day. Though in some sort, that great fortitude of Lambas de Auria, Duke of Genoa, seemeth to suit with my present estate and condition, who seeing his son was wounded to death, took him and threw him with his own arms forth of the ship into the sea. But such kind of deaths as these, though they take away life, yet they give reputation; and many times, men are enforced to undergo such actions, for to comply with their honour, and get themselves fame and renown. But what did enforce my daughter to die, but only the strong force of love? What remedy now, (Thou flattering world) wilt thou afford my wearisome age? How wouldst thou have me to rely upon thee, I knowing thy falsehoods,<pb facs="107" n="201"/> thy gins, thy snares, and thy nets, wherein thou entrap'st and takest our weak and feeble wills? Tell me, what hast thou done with my daughter? where hast thou bestowed her? who shall accompany my disaccompanied habitation? who shall cherish me in mine old age? who with gentle usage shall cocker my decaying years? O love, love, I did not think thou hadst had the power to kill thy subjects! I was wounded by thee in my youth: did pass thorough the midst of thy flames. Why didst thou let me scape? Was it that thou mightst pay me home (For my flying from thee then) in mine old age? I had well thought, that I had been freed from thy snares, when I once began to grow towards forty; and when I rested contented with my wedded consort, and when I saw I had that fruit, which this day thou hast cut down, I did not dream that thou wouldst in the children have taken vengeance of the parents; and I know not whether thou woundest with the sword, or burnest with fire. Thou leavest our clothes whole, and yet most cruelly woundest our hearts; thou makest that which is foul, to seem fair and beautiful unto us. Who gave thee so great a power? who gave thee that name which so ill befitteth thee? If thou wert love, thou wouldst love thy servants; and if thou didst love them, thou wouldst not punish them as thou dost. If to be thy fellow, were to live merrily, so many would not kill themselves, as my daughter now hath, and infinite of us. What end have thy servants and their ministers had? as also that false bawd, Celestina, who died by the hands of the faithfullest companions, that ever she lighted upon in her life, for their true performance in this thy venomous and empoisoned service? They lost their heads; Calisto, he broke his neck; and my daughter, to imitate him, submitted herself to the selfsame death. And of all this thou wast the cause; they gave thee a sweet name; but thy deeds are exceeding sour: thou dost not give equal rewards; and that law is unjust, which is not equal alike unto all. Thy voice promiseth pleasure, but thy actions proclaim pain; happy are they who have not known thee, or knowing thee, have not cared for thee. Some led with, I know not what error, have not sticked to call thee a god; but I would have such fools as these to consider with themselves, it savours not of a deity, to murder or destroy those that serve and follow him. O thou enemy to all reason! To those that serve thee least, thou givest thy greatest rewards, until thou hast brought them at last into this thy troublesome dance. Thou art an enemy to thy friends, and a friend to thy enemies; and all this is, because thou dost not govern thyself according to order and reason. They paint thee blind, poor, and young; they put a bow into thy hand, wherein thou drawest, and shootest at random; but more blind are they that serve thee. For they never taste or see the unsavoury and distasteful recompense, which they receive by thy service; thy fire is of hot burning lightning, which scorches unto death, yet leaves no impression or print of any wound at all. The sticks which thy flames consume, are the souls<pb facs="108" n="202"/> and lives of humane creatures, which are so infinite, and so numberless, that it scarce accurreth unto me, with whom I should first begin, not only of Christians, but of gentiles and of Jews; and all forsooth in requital of their good services. What shall I speak of that Macias of our times; and how by loving, he came to his end? Of whose sad and woeful death, thou wast the sole cause. What service did Paris do thee? What Helena? What Clytaemnestra? What Aegisthus? All the world knows how it went with them. How well likewise didst thou requite Sapho, Ariadne, and Leander, and many other besides, whom I willingly silence, because I have enough to do in the repetition of mine own misery? I complain me of the world, because I was bred up in it; for had not the world given me life, I had not therein begotten Melibea; not being begotten, she had not been born; not being born, I had not loved her; and not loving her, I should not have mourned, as now I do, in this my latter and uncomfortable old age! O my good companion! O my bruised daughter, bruised even all to pieces! Why wouldst thou not suffer me to divert thy death? why wouldst thou not take pity of thy kind and loving mother? why didst thou show thyself so cruel against thy aged father? why hast thou left me thus in sorrow? why hast thou left me comfortless, and all alone, in hâc lachrimarum valle, in this veil of tears, and shadow of death?</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
