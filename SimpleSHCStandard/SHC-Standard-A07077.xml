           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A07077-e100090">I have ever more endeavoured to know myself, than to be known of others: and rather to be unpartially beloved of all, than factiously to be admired of a few: yet so powerfully have I been enticed with the delights of poetry, and (I must ingeniously confess) above better desert so fortunate in these stage-pleasings, that (Let my resolutions be never so fixed to call mine eyes into myself,) I much fear that most lamentable death of him,<quote xml:id="A07077-e100100"><l xml:id="A07077-e100110">Qui nimis notus omnibus,</l><l xml:id="A07077-e100120">Ignotus moritur sibi. <note anchored="true" place="margin" xml:id="A07077-e100130">Seneca</note></l></quote></p>

        <p xml:id="A07077-e100220">As for the factious malice, and studied detractions of some few that tread in the same path with me, let all know, I most easily neglect them, and (Carelessly slumbering to their vicious endeavours) smile heartily at their selfe-hurting baseness. My bosom friend good Epictetus makes me easily to contemn all such men's malice: since other men's tongues are not within my teeth, why 〈…〉<pb facs="3"/> let this be printed, that of men of my own addiction, I love most, pity some, hate none: for let me truly say it, I once only loved myself, for loving them, and surely, I shall ever rest so constant to my first affection, that let their ungentle combinings, discourteous whisperings, never so treacherously labour to undermine my unfenced reputation, I shall (As long as I have being) love the least of their graces, and only pity the greatest of their vices.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
