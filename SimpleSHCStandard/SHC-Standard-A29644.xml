           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Broome a person whose excellency in comical wit has been sufficiently proved, and needs not my partial and weak commendation. There are published already of his plays, the Northern lass, the antipodes, the asparagus-garden, the merry beggars, the Lancashire witches, besides the 5. Plays lately published in a volume. The good acceptance of all which encourages me to publish this, being no way inferior to the rest; but when 'twas written, or where acted, I know not. Your kind entertainment of this will enable me to make known to the world divers more of the same authors works of this kind, which have not yet seen light; for my aim is, et prodesse et delectare, by delighting thee to profit myself.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
