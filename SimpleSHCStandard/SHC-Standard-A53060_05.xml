           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Ay, nor no other, should offer, or dare to speak before, or to such supreme persons as your majesty, without a sore premeditation; for the words and behaviours of speakers should be fitted to the degrees and qualities, powers, offices, and authorities of the auditory; but your majesty's commands makes that an obedient duty, that would otherways be a presumption; wherefore, on the ground of duty I speak at this time before your majesty; but the royalty of your person, the brightness of your beauty, the fame of your virtues, and the glorious splendour of your majestical grandeur hath so amazed me, that my understanding is as it were blind, which will cause my tongue to stagger, and my words to run stumbling out of my mouth; but I hope your justice will pardon them; for, as divine justice belongs to the gods, moral justice to nature; so humane justice to monarchial princes, which justice is weighed and measured out according to merit, or desert, be they good or bad: for which justice gods and princes are both feared and loved; and justice is the chief pillar or upholder of monarchical states and commonwealths; for without justice there can be no government, and without government there can be no rule, and without rule there can be no peace, and where peace is not, there will be wars and, wars causeth ruin and destruction; but for the most part, those kingdoms that have arrived to the height of glory, declines or falls to ruin: the reason is, that a low condition is necessitated, and weak; wherefore they seek for help to strengthen themselves, which makes or rather forces every particular person to associate, and unite either by laws of covenants, to which they submit and obey: but when a kingdom is in a glorious condition, and is full of prosperity, every particular citizen or man thinks he can stand upon his own foundation, flinging off their supporters, which is duty, and obedience, which makes them fall to ruin; for when men comes to that height of pride, caused by prosperity, that they all strive to be superiors, and commanders; they become factious and mutinous against the magistrates, rulers, or governors; which factions begets wars, either by calling in foreigners, or by making, or siding into parties amongst themselves; for it is to be observed, that states, or monarchies do oftener fall by the pride and factions of the commons, or subjects, than by the tyranny of the rulers or governors; but it is the nature of the vulgar sort of mankind, to be the most basest, fearfullest and dejected creatures in adversity, that nature hath made, and in prosperity to be the proudest, insultingest and imperious and cruelest of all creatures.

But in the public, life swims as in a full sea, having a fair gale of observation, and sails of opportune time to swim withal, marking the card of actions, and the needle of dispositions<pb facs="91" n="159"/> drawn or turned by the loadstone of affection, to the north-pole of experience, to guide me safe from the rocks of slander, and quicksands of scandal, till I come to the port of death, there to unload my life's merchandise; and I hope my voyage may be so prosperous, as I may be enriched with the praises of after-ages.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_05-e101520">Likewise, the reason why I choose to speak in public, is, that I would not speak idly, for in public I shall take care of what I speak, and to whom I speak, when in private visitations to single persons, my speech may be careless with negligence, in which I may throw away my time with my words; for, to speak to no purpose, is to make words useless, and words is the marks to distinguish things, and figures to number merits with, and notes to record the noble acts of men.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_05-e101530">But at this time I am to speak by my father's command, upon a subject which my contemplation hath no acquaintance with, which is marriage, and I hear by my father, that you have all treated with him, or rather entreated him to bestow me in marriage, which is to make me unhappy, not but that I believe what I hear, which is, that you are all persons of quality, birth, breeding, and merit, far beyond my desert, yet with the best, if any best there be, being all worthy; yet were I a wife to any one, I might be unhappy, by reason marriage is an encumbered life, although the husband and the wife were fitly matched for years, births, fortunes, dispositions, humours, capacities, wits, conversations, constancies, virtues, and affections; and first, by your leave, I will discourse of men's marriage, by reason man being accounted the supremer creature, and always bearing rule, he shall be first placed. As for marriage, to men it is a great hindrance to a speculative life, it cuts off fancies wings, and quenches out the poetical fire, it breaks the engine of invention, disturbs sweet contemplation, corrupts honest counsels, obstructs all heroic actions, obscures fame, and often times causes infamy by the wife's inconstancies, and many times by her indiscretion; for a man is dishonoured if his wife is but thought wanton, or but inclining to be amorous, and though she be as sober in her nature, and as constant as any woman can be, yet the very suspicion is a disgrace, and if the suspicion is a disgrace, what is a visible truth? His very neighbours makes horns as he passeth by their doors, whilst he sadly and shamefully hangs down his head with a dejected countenance, which makes him seem a coward and a fool, although it be unjust that the faults of the wife should be a blemish to the husband's honour; yet so it is, this being the greatest cause why husbands are jealous, which jealousy is more for their honour's sake, than for their wives affections; thus you see how dangerous a thing it is for man to marry, who must trust his honour to the management of a foolish woman, and women naturally like children, inconstant, unless education doth rectify their frail natures, peevish humours, various appetites, and inconstant affection: likewise marriage is not only apt to corrupt the mind with jealousy, but with covetousness; for the extreme fondness and natural love of parents to their children, makes them strive by all their endeavours to enrich them; this makes them gripe their tenants, pinch and half starve their servants, quarrel and dispute with their neighbours, corrupt judges take bribes, besides it makes men apt to rebel, and turn traitorous, murmuring at their taxes and impositions, it also makes them timorous and fearful in wars, by reason their wife and children may be ruined by their death. Also it makes them dull in their conversations,<pb facs="92" n="160"/> by reason they are always plodding for their worldly affairs; and for the Muses, had a husband time to entertain them, yet the wife would right them, or drive them from him, with their quarrelling disputes, or senseless prizes; besides most women are as jealous of the Muses, as of their maids; but to treat or discourse of married women, is to discourse of a most unhappy life, for all the time of their lives is ensnared with troubles, what in breeding and bearing children, what in taking and turning away servants, directing and ordering their family, counting their expenses, and disbursing their revenues, besides the vexations with their servants, for their quarrelling and combining, for their sloth and sluttery, for their spoils and carelessness, for their treachery and cozenage, and if they have children, what troubles and griefs do ensue? Troubled with their frowardness and untowardness, the care for their well being, the fear for their ill doing, their grief for their sickness, and their unsufferable sorrow for their death; yet this is the best part, and not to be avoided: but if these troubles be joined with an ill husband, it heightens their torments; for if he be a drunkard, she had better be married to a beast, her nostrils is staunched with the lees of wine, her eyes are offended with his rude behaviour, and her ears are struck with a cursed noise of cursing and oaths; and if he be a gamester, she lives in an unsettled condition, she knows not how soon she may want; for if she have plenty one day, she may be in a condition to beg the next. And if her husband be inconstant, and loves variety of women: oh how jealousy torments her, besides the wrongs she suffers from him! what affronts she receives from his mistress! How is she despised amongst her neighbours? slighted by her servant, suspected by the world for having some defect? as either to be incontinent, sluttish, foolish, froward, cross, unkind, ill natured, sickly, or diseased, when perchance the woman may be worthy to be marched with a temperate, wise, valiant, honest, rich and honourable man; and if women go fine, and take pleasure in themselves, and garments, their husbands are jealous; and if they regard not themselves or garments, their husbands dislikes them; for though men will swear to their wives they like them better in their old clothes, than other women in their glorious apparel; because they would not have them expensive, yet if their wives neglect themselves, regarding not their dressing, but sleights all outward adornments, and change of garments as prodigal spendthrifts, they starve their husbands esteem in their thrifty plainness, consumes their affections in their peiced petticoats, and buries their husbands love in their dirty rags; and from the dunghill of dirty rags, and grave of soul linen, is their husbands transformed to beastly adulteries, stealing by degrees out of one form into another, as from a doting husband, to a fond husband, form a fond to a discreet husband, from a discreet, to a careful husband, from a careful, to a careless, from a careless, to a disliking, from a disliking, to a hating, and then they begin to wander; as first, an eye glances, from an eye glance, to an admirer; from an admirer, to a professor, from a professor, to a dissembler; from a dissembler, to an adulterer; then for the dresses and garments of his mistress, first, from clean, to new; from new, to fine; from fine, to brave; from brave, to glorious; from glorious to fantastical; from fantastical to profusely various from profusely, various to any dirty slut. But his wife (On the other side, if his wife desires) appears handsome, and practises civil behaviour, and endeavours to be fine, takes care to be cleanly, observes to be fashionable, her<pb facs="92" n="161"/> husband straight becomes jealous, although she doth this for his sake, and to keep his affection, yet he thinks it is for the affection and sake of some other man, which causeth private discontents, from private discontents to quarrelling disputes; from quarrelling disputes, to public exclamations, from public exclamations, to open defiance; from open defiance, to divorcement; and though I cannot say this by, or from experience, having it only from relation, yet I do as faithfully believe it, as if I were experienced therein: on which faith, I made a vow never to marry, since I hear men are so hard to please, and apt to change; wherefore if I were married, instead of discoursing of several arguments, I should be groaning and sighing, and weeping, with several pains and vexations; and instead of a silent solitary contemplation, a clamorous quarrelsome conversation; instead of a peaceable life, I should be always in civil wars; and instead of being happy, I should be miserable; for marriage is like a ship, which always lies on the roughest billows of the sea, rolling from side to side with discontents, sailing uncertainly, with inconstancy, and various winds, but noble, civil, kind and affectionate gentlemen, as I have told you, I have made a vow never to marry, and surely marriage is not so happy an estate, or so pleasing a condition of life, as to persuade me to break my vow, neither can flattering rhetoric, nor enticing beauty, nor adoring, admiring, deploring, praying, weeping suitors persuade me, no, not a bleeding suitor, were I sure he would die, did he not enjoy me; for I will never be so dishonourable, perjurious, and impious, to break the holy laws, and pull the virgin altars down, built in the conscience, on which are vows offered to gods on high: should I blow out that with faint inconstancy, that pure bright vestal fire of innocency, from whence the essence of chaste thoughts ascends to heaven high; but rather than I would break my vow, I wish my ears as deaf as death, that hears no flattering sounds, nor sad complaints, nor terrifying threats, my eyes as dark as night, lest light should bring some false deluding object in, for to deceive me; my heart like adamant, so hard love cannot enter, nor pity nor compassion wound; but howsoever, I cannot be wife to you all; wherefore since I cannot be every man's wife, I will die every man's maid. But I must tell this noble assembly, their meeting hath occasioned a quarrel here; for bashfulness, and confidence hath fought a duel in my cheeks, and left the stains of blood there.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
