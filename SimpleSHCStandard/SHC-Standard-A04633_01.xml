           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100620">Gentlemen, have a little patience, they are e'en upon coming, instantly ▪ he that should begin the play, master Littlewit, the proctor, has a stitch new fallen in his black silk stocking; 'twill be drawn up ere you can tell twenty. He plays one o'the arches, that dwells about the hospital, and he has a very pretty part. But for the whole play, will you ha'the truth on't? (I am looking, lest the poet hear me, or his man, master Broome, behind the arras) it is like to be a very conceited scurvy one, in plain English. When't comes to the fair, once: you were e'en as good go to Virginia, for any thing there is of Smithfield. He has not hit the humours, he does not know 'em; he has not conversed with the bartholmew-birds, as they say; he has never a sword, and buckler man in his fair, nor a little Davy, to take toll o'the bawds there, as in my time, nor a kind-heart, if anybody's teeth should chance to ache in his play. Nor a juggler with a well-educated ape to come over the chain, for the King of England, and back again for the prince, and sit still on his arse for the Pope, and the King of Spain! None o'these fine sights! Nor has he the canvas-cut i'the night, for a hobby-horse-man to creep into his she-neighbour, and take his leap,<pb facs="5"/> there! Nothing! No, and some writer (That I know) had had but the penning of this matter, he would ha' made you such a jig-a-jog i'the booths, you should ha' thought an earthquake had been i'the fair! But these master-poets, they will ha' their own absurd courses; they will be informed of nothing! He has (Sirreverence) kicked me three, or four times about the tiring-house, I thank him, for but offering to put in, with my experience. I'll be judged by you, gentlemen, now, but for one conceit of mine! would not a fine pump upon the stage ha' done well, for a property now? and a punk set under upon her head, with her stern upward, and ha' been soused by my witty young masters o'the inns of court? what think you o'this for a show, now? he will not hear o'this! I am an ass! I! and yet I kept the stage in master Tarlton's time, I thank my stars. Ho! and that man had lived to have played in Bartholmew fair, you should ha' seen him ha' come in, and ha' been cozened i'the cloth-quarter, so finely! And Adams, the rogue, ha' leaped and capered upon him, and ha' dealt his vermin about, as though they had cost him nothing. And then a substantial watch to ha' stolen in upon 'em, and taken 'em away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in the stage-practice.</p>

And yet he may, i'the most o'this matter i'faith:<pb facs="5"/> for the author hath writ it just to his meridian, and the scale of the grounded judgements here, his playfellows in wit.

In which time the author promiseth to present them by us, with a new sufficient play called Bartholmew fair, merry, and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none. Provided they have either, the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100730">It is further agreed that every person here, have his or their freewill of censure, to like or dislike at their own charge, the author having now departed with his right: it shall be lawful for any man to judge his six pen'orth his twelve pen'orth, so to his eighteen pence, 2. shillings, half a crown, to the value of his place: provided always his place get not above his wit. And if he pay for half a<pb facs="6"/> dozen, he may censure for all them too, so that he will undertake that they shall be silent. He shall put in for censures here, as they do for lots at the lottery: marry if he drop but six pence at the door, and will censure a crown's worth, it is thought there is no conscience, or justice in that.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100740">It is also agreed, that every man here, exercise his own judgement, and not censure by contagion, or upon trust, from another's voice, or face, that sits by him, be he never so first, in the commission of wit: as also, that he be fixed and settled in his censure, that what he approves, or not approves today, he will do the same tomorrow, and if tomorrow, the next day, and so the next week (If need be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the bench with him, though they indite, and arraign plays daily. He that will swear, Jeronimo, or Andronicus are the best plays, yet, shall pass unexcepted at, here, as a man whose judgement shows it is constant, and hath stood still, these five and twenty, or thirty years. Though it be an ignorance, it is a virtuous and stayed ignorance; and next to truth, a confirmed error does well; such a one the author knows where to find him.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100750">It is further covenanted, concluded and agreed, that how great soever the expectation be, no person here, is to expect more than he knows, or better ware than a fair will afford: neither to look back to the sword and buckler-age of Smithfield, but content himself with the present. In stead of a little Davy; to take toll o'the bawds, the author doth promise a strutting horse-courser, with a leer-drunkard, two or three to attend him, in as good equipage as you would wish. And then for kind-heart, the tooth-drawer, a fine oily pig-woman with her tapster, to bid you welcome, and a consort of roarers for music. A wise justice of peace meditant, in stead of a juggler, with an ape. A civil cutpurse searchant. A sweet singer of new ballads<pb facs="6"/> allurant: and as fresh an hypocrite, as ever was broached rampant. If there be never a servant-monster i'the fair; who can help it? he says; nor a nest of antiques? He is loath to make nature afraid in his plays, like those that beget tales, tempests, and such like drolleries, to mix his head with other men's heels; let the concupiscence of jigs and dances, reign as strong as it will amongst you: yet if the puppets will please anybody , they shall be entreated to come in.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100760">In consideration of which, it is finally agreed, by the foresaid hearers, and spectators, that they neither in themselves conceal, nor suffer by them to be concealed any state-decipherer, or politic picklock of the scene, so solemnly ridiculous, as to search out, who was meant by the gingerbread-woman, who by the hobby-horse-man, who by the costard-monger, nay, who by their wares. Or that will pretend to affirm (On his own inspired ignorance) what mirror of magistrates is meant by the justice, what great lady by the pig-woman, what concealed statesman, by the seller of mousetraps, and so of the rest. But that such person, or persons so found, be left discovered to the mercy of the author, as a forfeiture to the stage, and your laughter, aforesaid. As also, such as shall so desperately, or ambitiously, play the fool by his place aforesaid, to challenge the author of scurrility, because the language somewhere savours of Smithfield, the booth, and the pig-broth, or of profaneness, because a madman cries, God quit you, or bless you. In witness whereof, as you have preposterously put to your seals already (Which is your money) you will now add the other part of suffrage, your hands, the play shall presently begin. And though the fair be not kept in the same region, that some here, perhaps, would have it, yet think ▪ that therein the author hath observed a special decorum, the place being as dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.</p>
          <p xml:id="A04633_01-e100770"><pb facs="7"/>Howsoever, he prays you to believe, his ware is still the same, else you will make him justly suspect that he that is so loath to look on a baby, or an hobby-horse, here, would be glad to take up a commodity of them, at any laughter, or loss, in another place.</p>

Horace calls him) that could discover a justice of peace, (And lately of the quorum) under this covering. They may have seen many a fool in the habit of a justice; but never till now, a justice in the habit of a fool. Thus must we do, though, that wake for the public good: and thus hath the wise magistrate done in all ages. There is a doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found. Never shall I enough commend a worthy worshipful man, sometime a capital member of this city, for his high wisdom, in this point, who would take you, now the habit of a porter; now of a carman; now of the dog-killer, in this month of August; and in the winter, of a seller of tinderboxes; and what would he do in all these shapes? marry go you into every alehouse, and down into every cellar; measure the length of puddings, take the gage of black pots, and cans, ay, and custards with a stick; and their circumference, with a thread; weigh the loaves of bread on his middle-finger; then would he send for 'em, home; give the puddings to the poor, the bread to the hungry, the custards to his children; break the pots, and burn the cans, himself; he would not trust his corrupt officers; he would do't himself. would all men in authority would follow this worthy precedent! For (Alas) as we are public persons, what do we know? nay, what can we know? we hear with other men's ears; we see with other men's eyes? A foolish constable, or a sleepy watchman,<pb facs="15" n="17"/> is all our information, he slanders a gentleman, by the virtue of his place, (As he calls it) and we by the vice of ours, must believe him. As a while ago, they made me, yea me, to mistake an honest zealous pursuivant, for a seminary: and a proper young bachelor of music, for a bawd. This we are subject to, that live in high place, all our intelligence is idle, and most of our intelligencers, knaves: and by your leave, ourselves, thought little better, if not errant fools, for believing 'em. I Adam Overdoo, am resolved therefore, to spare spy-money hereafter, and make mine own discoveries. Many are the yearly enormities of of this fair, in whose courts of piepowders I have had the honour during the three days sometimes to sit as judge. But this is the special day for detection of those foresaid enormities. Here is my black book, for the purpose; this the cloud that hides me: under this covert I shall see, and not be seen. On Junius Brutus. And as I began, so I'll end: in justice name, and the Kings; and for the commonwealth.</p>

If I had not already forgiven you a greater trespass, or thought you yet worth my beating, I would instruct your manners, to whom you made your offers. But go your ways, talk not to me, the hangman is only fit to discourse with you; the hand of beadle is too merciful a punishment for your trade of life. I am sorry I employed this fellow; for he thinks me such: facinus quos inquinat, aequat. But, it was for sport. And would I make it serious, the getting of this licence is nothing to me, without other circumstances concur. I do think how impertinently I labour, if the word be not mine, that the ragged fellow marked: and what advantage I have given Ned Win-wife in this time now, of working her, though it be mine. He'll go near to form to her what a debauched rascal I am, and fright her out of all good conceit of me: I should do so by him, I am sure, if I had the opportunity. But my hope is in her temper, yet; and it must needs be next to despair, that is grounded on any part of a woman's discretion. I would give by my troth, now, all I could spare (To my clothes, and my sword) to meet my tattered soothsayer again, who was my judge i'the question, to know certainly whose word he has damned or saved. For, till then, I live but under a reprieve. I must seek him. Who be these?</p>

Good sir, hear me, I am worth six thousand pound, my love to you, is become my rack, I'll tell you all, and the truth: since you hate the hypocrisy of the particoloured brotherhood. These seven years, I have been a wilful holy widow, only to draw feasts, and gifts from my entangled suitors: I am also by office, an assisting sister of the deacons, and a devourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms. I am a special maker of marriages for our decayed brothers, with our rich widows; for a third part of their wealth, when they are married, for the relief of the poor elect: as also our poor handsome young virgins, with our wealthy bachelors, or widowers; to make them steal from their husbands, when I have confirmed them in the faith, and got all put into their custodies. And if I ha' not my bargain, they may sooner turn a scolding drab, in to a silent minister, then make me leave pronouncing reprobation, and damnation unto them. Our elder, Zeal-of-the-land, would have had me, but I know him to be the capital knave of the land, making himself rich, by being made feoffee in trust to deceased brothers, and cozening their heirs, by swearing the absolute gift of their inheritance. And thus having eased my conscience, and uttered my heart, with the tongue of my love: enjoy all my deceits together. I beseech you. I should not have revealed this to you, but that in time I think you are mad, and I hope you'll think me so too, sir?</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
