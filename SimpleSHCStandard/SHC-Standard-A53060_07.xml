           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Is it that you think I have beauty? and is it that you are in love with? why, to cure your disease, I will deform it; or do you think I have wit to cure that imagination? I will put my tongue to silence. I am sure it cannot be my virtue that inflames you to an intemperance; for virtue is an antidote against it: but had you all the beauty in nature squeezed into your form, and all the wit in nature pressed into your brain, and all the prosperities of good fortune at your command, and all the power of fate and destiny at your disposal, you could not persuade me to yield to your unlawful desires; for know, I am honest without self-ends; my virtue, like to time, still running forward, my chastity fixed as eternity, without circumferent lines; besides, it is built on the foundation of morality, and roofed and ceiled with the faith of religion, and the materials thereof are honour, which no subtle arguments can shake the one, nor no false doctrine can corrupt or rot the other; neither is the building subject to the fire of unlawful love, nor the tempestuous storms of torments, nor the deluge of poverty, nor the earthquakes of fear, nor the ruins of death; for so long as my soul hath a being, my chastity will live. But were you as poor as I, even to move pity, or so lowly and meanly born, at might bring contempt and scorn from the proud, yet if your mind and soul were endued with noble qualities, and heroical virtues, I should sooner embrace your love, than to be mistress of the whole world; for my affection to merit hath been ingrafted into the root of my infancy, which hath grown up with my years, so that the longer I live, the more it increases.</p>

              <p xml:id="A53060_07-e103240">I did imagine myself married, my husband being a general of an army, who had fought many battles, and had won many victories, conquered many nations, at last an unfortunate day of battle being fought, my husband being too active and venturous, making lanes of slain bodies as he went, and his horse riding thorough rivers of blood, those rivers rising so high, as his horse was forced to swim; but the blood growing thick to a jelly, obstructed his way, which made his horse furious, which fury added to his strength, forced a passage over a hill, or heap of slain bodies; but the horses spirits being spent with fury and labour, fell strengthless to the ground, with my husband upon his back; and being in the midst of his enemy's army, his enemies seeing him fall, ran about him in great numbers, and so took him prisoner: whereupon his soldiers soon missing him, thought he was killed; upon which belief, their courages grew cold, their limbs unactive, and their spirits so benumbed, as they all seemed like to a number of stone-statues; which unactive dulness gave their enemies the day without any after-blows. I being in the camp, hearing of my husband's misfortunes, ran with a distracted fear towards the enemy's camp; I being espied by some of my husband's scattered troops, was stopped in the way, and so brought back to my tent again; where, when I was there, some of my husband's officers of the army told me, that though the day was lost, yet there was a considerable body left; which I no sooner heard, but my spirits took new life, and then excusing my fear, told those commanders it was not through fear that made me run out of my tent; for I did<pb facs="122" n="212"/> not fly from my enemies, but to them, and that I sought death, and not life; and to express my courage, I told them, that if they would give me leave, I would take my husband's office, and lead the army: they told me, that if the rest of the commanders would agree to it, they were well contented: so when all the commanders met together, I spoke thus unto them.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_07-e103250">Noble friends, and valiant soldiers, you may think it a vain ambition for me to desire to lead your army, especially against so potent an enemy, and being a woman, which female sex are usually unexperienced in martial affairs, as also by nature fearful, which fears may ruin an army, by giving wrong direction, causing a confusion through distraction; and truly an army were not to be trusted unto a woman; management and ordering, if that records had not given us precedents, which is, that woman have led armies, have fought valiantly themselves, and have had good success, and not so much by fortune's favour, as by their own wise conduct: and to show that Pallas is a friend unto her own sex, is, that in all history, there are very few women then can be found, that have lost battles in the field of wars, but many that have won battles; and in all public affairs it is to be observed, the gods do generally assist our sex, whereby to show their own power, and to abate the haughty pride of men. But to induce you more; for men trust not so much unto the gods, as to their own strength, is, that you are present in all counsels and actions, to assist and direct me; besides, I am wife unto your general, who was and is an expert soldier, and a valiant man, although he now had ill fortune; but ill fortune neither lessens valour nor experience, but rather increases them. This gallant and wise man, my husband and your general, his discourses have been my tutors, and his example hath and shall be my guide; and if you dare trust me, I dare venture; otherwise I shall stay in my tent, and pray for your good success. After I had left off speaking, an old commander which had served long in the wars, and was much esteemed, answered me as thus.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_07-e103260">Noble lady, although your youth doth dissuade us, yet your beauty and wit doth encourage us; for what man, although he were possessed with fear itself, can run away when a fair lady sights? for beauty triumphs in all hearts, and commands the whole world: wherefore that man that shall or will deny to follow your command, is of a bastard-kind, although a lawful issue. With that all the rest of the commanders cried or called out, that none was so fit to lead and command them as I. Thus being chosen, I called a general muster of my soldiers, and then gave order that some of the broken regiments should be mended and made up with other broken regiments, also I made new officers in the room of those that were slain or taken prisoners, and after, I surveyed my artillery and ammunition; which done, I drew my army into a body, and after I had given order and directions for the soldiers to march towards the enemy's camp, which when the enemy heard of a new army coming towards them, they drew out the body of their army in battle array: but I shunned to fight so soon as appeared, by reason my army was tired with marching; wherefore I gave order to entrench: besides, I thought it might give my soldiers more courage, when accustomed to the fight and neighbourhood of the enemies: but withal, I made some of them give intelligence to the enemy that a woman led the army, by which they might despise us, and so become<pb facs="123" n="222"/> more negligent, by which negligence we might have an advantage: in the mean time I sent to treat of a peace, and to have my husband set at liberty; but the enemy was so averse to a peace, as they returned me both jesting and scornful answers: so when I saw no peace could be made, I drew out my army into battle array; which when the enemy perceived, they did the like; but it will be too tedious at this time to tell the form and figures I put my army into, as also what commanders led, or who commanded the horse, or who commanded the foot that day; only let me tell you, I led the van myself, and was accoutred after this manner: I had a masculine suit, and over that a cloth of silver coat, made close to my waste, which reached to the ankles of my legs; and those arms I wore being all gilt, were back, breast, gorget, pot and gauntlet, all being made light according as my strength would bear: in my hand I carried my sword; for being not accustomed, I could not wear a sword by my side, as men do, but whensoever rested, I tied it to my saddlebow, and on my head-piece I wore a great plume of feathers: as for my horse, he was coal-black, only a white star on his forehead, and three white feet; my saddle was crimson velvet, but so embroidered with silver and gold, as the ground could not be seen: but when I was mounted, I spoke as following unto the common soldiers.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_07-e103270">Worthy friends, and laborous, and valiant soldiers, you may justly wonder to see a woman thus accoutred like a man, and being one of the tender female sex to be armed as a soldier, and in a posture to fight a battle: also you may fear the success of my command, by reason I am young, and unexperienced, as also unpractised in the wars: but fear not, the gods are with me, and will assist me, and have promised to give you victory by my conduct; for they will conduct me: but the gods suffered the other battle to be lost, because many victories had made you proud, and conceited of yourselves, and your own valours, trusting more to your own strength, than to their favours or powers, whereupon the gods destroyed many of you; but since they have taken pity of you, drawn to it by your humility: whereupon the gods have commanded me to lead and conduct you; and they have also commanded me to tell you, that if you trust in them, and fight courageously, that you shall have victory, and rich spoils; for I heard the common people, of which common soldiers were of, were apt to be superstitious, and to believe in any new reports, as also to believe in miracles, prophecies, and the like, and withal, very covetous; all which, made me feign myself to be commanded immediately from the gods, and to be sent as from the gods to command them, and to declare such promises to them; for all the common soldier's sight for spoils, not for honour.</p>

Is it not as great a blemish to the honour of a woman, to be said to be unchaste, as for a man to be said to be a coward? And shall a woman only sit and weep over her lost honour, whilst a man fights to regain his? And shall it be thought no dishonour for a man to pistol, or at least bastonade another man for an injury, or an affront received, and a fault for a woman to do, or cause to be done the like? Must women only sit down with foolish patience, and endure wrong, when men may execute revenge with fury? These were both injustice, and an unjust act of education to our sex; as also it would be an unjust sentence, not only from men, but from the gods, since neither gods nor men will suffer injury, wrong, or dishonour, without revenge: but if gods, men, and education should be so unjust to our sex, yet there is no reason in nature we should be so unjust to ourselves: but for my part, as I am constant to an honest friend, and can easily forgive an honourable enemy, so I can never forgive a malicious foe, nor forget a vainglorious bragging fool, or false slandering knave, but will persecute them to the utmost of my power, and the weight of my revenge should be according to the pressure of my injury, or dishonour.</p>

Whereupon I gravely turned the incorporal head of my rational soul, nodding it to them to be quiet, and let me alone, but still they played with me: at last my thoughts, which are the language of the soul, spoke to them, and prayed them to forbear, until such time as the sciences were gone; but they would not be quiet, nor silent, do<pb facs="131" n="239"/> what I could, but would interrupt the sciences in the midst of their discourse, with their idle rhymes, light fancies, and odd numbers, insomuch as the sciences departed: whereupon the muses did rejoice, and skip, and run about, as if they had been wild: and in this jocund humour, in came the arts, even a whole commonwealth; for there were not only politic arts, civil and combining arts, profitable and necessary arts, military arts, and ceremonious arts; but there were superstitious arts, idolatrous arts, false, factious, and mischievous arts, destructive and wicked arts, base and mean art, foolish, childish, vain, superfluous and unprofitable arts: upon all these arts the Muses made good sport; for at some they flung jests, scorns, and scoffs, and some they stripped naked, but to others they were cruel, for some they stayed their skins off, and others they made very skeletons of, dissecting them to the very bones; and the truth is, they spared not the best of them, but they had one saying or other to them: but when all the arts departed, they took me, and carried to the well of Helicon, and there they threw me in over head and cares, and said they would souse me in the liquor of poetry; but when I was in the well, I thought verily I should have been drowned, for all my outward senses were smothered and choked, for the water did blind my eyes, stopped my ears and nostrils, and filled my mouth so full, as I had not so much space as to spout it forth; besides all my body was so numb, as I had no feeling, insomuch, as when they took me out of this well of Helicon, into which they had flung me, I seemed as dead, being quite senseless: whereupon they all agreed to take and carry me up on Parnassas hill, and to lay me on the 〈◊〉 thereof, that the poetical flame, or heat therein, might dry and warm me; after which agreement they took me up, every one bearing a part of me, or was industrious about me, for some carried my head, others my legs, some held my hands, others embraced my waste, another oiled my tongue, and others poured spirits into my mouth, but the worst-natured muse pinched me, to try if I was sensible, or not, and the sweetest and tenderest natured muse wept over me, and another was so kind as to kiss me; but when they had brought me up to the top of the hill, and laid me thereupon, I felt such a heat, as if they had laid me on Aetna; but after I had lain some time, I felt it not so hot, and so less and less, until I felt it like as my natural heat; just like those that go into a hot bath, at first cry out it is insufferable and scalding hot, yet with a little use will find it cool enough: but whilst I lay on Parnassus hill, I began to make a lyric verse, as thus.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
