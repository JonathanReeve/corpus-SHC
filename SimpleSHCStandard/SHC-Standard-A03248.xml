           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Now farewell gunpowder, I must change thee into damask-powder; for if I offer but to smell like a soldier, the courtiers will stop their noses when they pass by me. My cask I must change to a cap and a feather, my bandillero to a scarf to hang my sword in, and indeed, fashion myself wholly to the humours of the time. My piece I must alter to a poynado, and my pike to a pickadevant: only this is my comfort, that our provant will be better here in the court than in the camp: there we did use to lie<pb facs="33"/> hard, and seldom: here I must practise to lie extremely, and often: but whilst I am trifling here, I shall lose the fight of the solemnity: the prince is married, and the marshal's married, and my master's married, there will be simple doings at night. Well, I must hence, for I believe, the King, the Queen, and the rest of the lords will use this place for their revels. Dixi. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
