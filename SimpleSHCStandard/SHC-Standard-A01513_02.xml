           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

After he had been drawn twice about the stage, and retired, the music ceased, and Jocasta the Queen issued out of her house, beginning the first act, as followeth.</p>

Then came the ladies and dames that stood by, throwing in their chains and jewels, so to cause it stop up and close itself, but when it would not so be filled, came in a knight with his sword drawn, armed at all points, who walking twice or thrice about it, and perusing if, sing that it would neither be filled with earth nor with their jewels and ornaments, after solemn reverence done to the gods, and courteous leave taken of the ladies and standers by, suddenly leapt into the gulf the which did close up immediately, betokening unto us the love that every worthy person oweth unto his native country, by the history of Curtius, who for the like cause adventured the like in Rome. This done, blind Tiresias the divine prophet led in by his daughter, and conducted by Meneceus the son of Creon, entereth by the gates Electrae, and say as followeth.</p>

Hereby was noted the incomparable force of concord between brothers, who as long as they hold together may not easily by any means be overcome, and being once dissevered by any means, are easily overthrown.

          <p xml:id="A01513_02-e126390">First the stillpipes sounded a very mournful melody, in which time came upon the stage a woman clothed in a white garment, on her head a pillar, double faced, the foremost face fair and smiling, the other behind black and louring, muffled with a white lawn about her eyes, her lap full of jewels, sitting in a chariot, her legs naked, her feet set upon a great round ball, and being drawn in by iv noble personages, she led in a string on her right hand ii Kings crowned, and in her left hand ii poor slaves very meanly attired. After she was drawn about the stage, she stayed a little, changing the Kings unto the left hand and the slaves unto the right hand, taking the crowns from the King's heads she crowned therewith the ij. slaves, and casting the vile clothes of the slaves upon the Kings, she despoiled the Kings of their robes, and therewith apparelled the slaves. This done, she was drawn eftsoon about the stage in this order, and then departed, leaving unto us a plain type or figure of unstable fortune, who doth oftentimes raise to height of dignity the vile and unnoble, and in like manner throweth down from the place of promotion, even those whom before she herself had thither advanced: after her departure came in Duke Creon with four gentlemen waiting upon him, and lamented the death of Meneceus his son in this manner.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
