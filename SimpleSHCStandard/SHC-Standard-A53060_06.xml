           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

              <p xml:id="A53060_06-e100500">I did imagine myself such a beauty, as nature never made the like, both for person, favour, and colour, and a wit answerable to my beauty, and my breeding and behaviour answerable to both, my wisdom excelling all: and if I were not thus as I say, yet that every one should think I were so; for opinion creates more, and perfecter beauties, than nature doth. And then that a great powerful monarch, such a one as Alexander, or Caesar, fell desperately in love with me, seeing but my picture, which was sent all about the world; yet my picture (I did imagine) was to my disadvantage, not flattering me any ways; yet this prince to be enamoured with this shadow for the substance' sake: then love persuaded him to send me his picture, which represented him to the life, being extremely handsome, yet had a manly and wise countenance. This picture being brought by ambassadors, which ambassadors when they came, treated with me about marriage with this sole emperor, all other Kings and princes being but tributaries; receiving these ambassadors with great civility and respect, yet behaving myself with a reserved and majestical behaviour, which the ambassadors observing, said, I was the only lady that was fit to be the only emperor's wife, both for my beauty, carriage, and wit: when after a modest fear, and seeming humility, I had reasoned against the marriage, at last by their persuasion I consented; then was there post after post, and messenger after messenger, sent with letters from the emperor to me, and from me to the emperor; he admiring my letters, for the elegancy of the style, and eloquency of the wit, and admiring my picture for the beauty; one while<pb facs="103" n="183"/> reading my letters, and another while viewing my picture, made him impatient for my company, which made him send to his ambassadors, that with all speed they should bring me away, sending to all the princes whose kingdoms I was to pass thorough, that they should guard me with armies, but not retard me with Olimpias, or the like, but to convey me safe and speedily: whereupon I took my journey (Most of the kingdom where I was born petitioning to wait on me); but by reason I could not take them all, unless I should depopulate the kingdom, I would carry none, lest I should displease those that were to be left behind; but as I went out of the city where I dwelled, all the streets were strewed with dead lovers, which had lived only on hopes, so long as I lived amongst them: but when they knew for certain I was to depart, their hopes vanished, and they died with despair. The ambassadors seeing such a mortality, caused the army that was my guard to march apace, and my coaches to trundle away, thinking it was the plague; but at last, after my beauty had killed millions in the kingdoms I passed thorough, I arrived at that part of the world where the emperor was, who was a joyed man to hear of my coming, and had made great preparations against my arrival; but some few days before my arrival, he sent a chariot which was made of the thinnest plated gold, because it should be light in the carriage, but the body of the chariot was enamelled and set with precious stones, the horses trappings were only great chains of pearls, but the horses reigns were chains of gold, that might be strong enough to check their hot spirits, and swift speed; as for myself, I was only clothed in white satin, and a crown of diamonds on my head, like a bride, for I was to be married as soon as I met the emperor; but as I passed along, all the highways were beset with crowds of people, which thronged to see me, and when they saw me, they cried out I was an angel sent from the gods; but your coming spoiled the triumph, and broke the marriage.</p>

This man to fall desperately in love with me, as loving my virtues, honouring my merits, admiring my beauty, wondering at my wit, doting on my person, adoring me as an angel, worshipping me as a goddess; I was his life, his soul, his heaven. This lover courted my affection: with all the industry of life, gifts of fortune, and actions of honour; sued for my favour, as if he had sued to heaven for mercy; but I, as many cruel goddesses do, would neither receive his obligations, nor regard his vows, nor pity his tears, nor hearken to his complaints, but rejected his suit, and gave him an absolute denial; whereupon he was resolved to die, as believing no torments could be compared to those of my disdain; and since I would not love him living, he hoped by dying, his death might move my pity, and so beget a compassionate remembrance from me; whereupon he got secretly near my chamber-door, and hung himself just where I must go out, which when I saw, I starred back in a great fright, but at last running forth to call for help to cut him down, in came monsieur amorous, which hindrance made me leave him hanging there, as being ashamed to own my cruelty; and he hath been talking, or rather prating here so long, as by this time my kind love is dead.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
