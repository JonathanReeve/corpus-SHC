           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

And likewise it hath been so well approved by you in the acting of it upon the stage, and that with your loud alarms, (I mean your clapping of hands) that I could not choose but commend it to you now in print: for it is a play that is often acted; and when others fade and are out of date, yet this doth endure to the last: I know it may come short of that accurateness both in plot and style that this witty age doth with greater curiosity acquire,<pb facs="3"/> I may thus excuse; that as plays were then, some twenty years ago, it was in the fashion. Nor could it have found a fitter or more seasonable publication than at this time; when the glory of our nation is so much admired, and the valour of our English so much esteemed, that it is sought for by foreign natives, as you may read in this subject we have in hand; but I leave it to your perusal and imitation; and return to you my brave spirited gentlemen shoemakers, upon whom, and for whose sakes I have published it; wishing you all that have their courages and forwardness, their noble fates and fortunes: so hoping you will go through stitch, I leave thee to fare well. </p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
