           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <head>Â¶ To the right worshipful and virtuous ladies, the l. Anne grey, and the lady Mary Peter, long health of body, with quiet of mind, in the favour of God and men for ever. </head>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100110">It is most certain (Right virtuous and worshipful) that of all humane learning, poetry (How contemptible soever it is in these days, is the most ancient) and in poetry, there is no argument of more antiquity and elegancy than is the matter of love; for it seems to be as old as the world, and to bear date from the first time that man and woman was: therefore in this, as in the finest mettle, the freshest wits have in all ages shown their best workmanship. So amongst others these gentlemen, which with what sweetness of voice and liveliness of action they then expressed it, they which were of her majesty's right honourable maidens can testify.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100120">Which being a discourse of two lovers, perhaps it may seem a thing neither fit to be offered unto your ladyships, nor worthy me to busy myself withal: yet can I tell you madames, it differeth so far from the ordinary amorous discourses of our days, as the manners of our time do from the modestic and innocence of that age.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100130">And now for that weary winter is come upon us, which bringeth with him drooping days and tedious nights, if it be true, that the motions of our minds follow the temperature of the air wherein we live, than I think, the perusing of some mournful matter, tending to the view of a notable example, will refresh your wits in a gloomy day, and ease your weariness of the louring night. Which if it please you<pb facs="3"/> serve ye also for a solemn revel against this festival time, for Gismund's bloody shadow, with a little cost, may be entreated in her self-like person to speak to ye.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100140">Having therefore a desire to be known to your w I devised this way with myself to procure the same, persuading myself, there is nothing more welcome to your wisdoms, than the knowledge of wise, grave, and worthy matters, tending to the good instructions of youths, of whom you are mothers.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100150">In this respect therefore, I shall humbly desire ye to bestow a favour able countenance upon this little labour, which when ye have graced it withal, I must and will acknowledge myself greatly indebted unto your ladyships in this behalf: neither shall I amongst the rest, that admire your rare virtues, (Which are not a few in Essex) cease to commend this undeserved gentleness.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100160">Thus desiring the King of heaven to increase his graces in ye both, granting that your ends may be as honourable, as your lives are virtuous, I leave with a vain babble of many needless words to trouble you longer.</p>

        <head>To his friend R. W.</head>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100200">Maâr R: W. look not now for the tear of an entreater, I will beg no longer, and for your promises, I will refuse them as bad payment: neither can I be satisfied with any thing, but a peremptory performance of an old intention of yours, the publishing I mean of those waste papers (As it pleaseth you to call them, but as I esteem them, a most exquisite invention) of Gismund's tragedy. Think not to shift me off with longer delays, nor allege more excuses to get further respite, lest I arrest you with my Actâ est, and commence such a suit of unkindness against you, as when the case shall be scanned before the judges of courtesy, the court will cry out of your immoderate modesty. And thus much I tell you before, you shall not be able to wage against me in the charges growing upon this action, especially, if the worshipful company of the inner temple gentlemen patronize my cause, as undoubtedly they will, yea, and rather plead partially for me then let my cause miscarry, because themselves are parties. The tragedy was by them most pithily framed, and no less curiously acted in view of her majesty, by whom it was then as princely accepted, as of the whole honourable audience notably applauded: yâ, and of all men generally desired, as a work, either in stateliness of show, depth of conceit, or true ornaments of poetical art, inferior to none of the best in that kind: no, were the Roman Seneca the censurer. The brave youths that then (To their high praises) so feelingly performed the same in action, did shortly after lay up the look unregarded, or perhaps let it run abroad (As many parents do their children once passed dandling) not respecting so much what hard fortune might befall it being out of their ângers, as how their heroical wits might again be quickly conceived with new inventions of like worthiness, whereof they have been ever since wonderful fertile. But this orphan of theirs (For he wandreth as it were fatherless) hath notwithstanding, by the rare and beautiful perfections<pb facs="4"/> appearing in him, hetherâ never wanted great favourers, and loving preservers. Among whom I cannot sufficiently commend your more than charitable zeal, and scholarly compassion towards him, that have not only rescued and defended him from the devouring jaws of oblivion, but vouchsafed also to apparel him in a new suit at your own charges, wherein he may again more boldly come abroad, and by your permission return to his old parents, clothed perhaps not in richer or more costly furniture than it went from them, but in handsomeness and fashion more answerable to these times, wherein fashions are so often altered. Let one word suffice for your encouragement herein: namely, that your commendable pains in disrobing him of his antic curiosity, and adorning him with the approved guise of our stateliest English terms (Not diminishing, but more augmenting his artificial colours of absolute poesy, derived from his first parents) cannot but be grateful to most men's appetites, who upon our experience we know highly to esteem such lofty measures of sententiously composed tragedies.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100210">How much you shall make me, and the rest of your private friends beholding unto you, I list not to discourse: and therefore grounding upon these alleged reasons, that the suppressing of this tragedy, so worthy for that press, were no other thing then wilfully to defraud yourself of an universal thank, your friends of their expectations, and sweet G. of a famous eternity. I will cease to doubt of any other pretence to cloak your bashfulness, hoping to read it in print (Which lately lay neglected amongst your papers) at our next appointed meeting.</p>

        <head>To the worship full and learned society, the gentlemen students of the inner temple, with the rest of his singular good friends, the gentlemen of the middle temple, and to all other courteous readers, R. W. wisheth increase of all health, worship and learning, with the immortal glory of the graces adorning the same. </head>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100260">Ye may perceive (Right worshipful) in perusing the former epistle sent to me, how sore I am beset with the importunities of my friends, to publish this pamphlet: truly I am and have been (If there be in me any soundness of judgement) of this opinion, that whatsoever is committed to the press is commended to eternity, and it shall stand a lively witness with our conscience, to our comfort or confusion, in the reckoning of that great day.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100270">Advisedly therefore was that proverb used of our elder philosophers, manum a tabula: withhold thy hand from the paper, and thy papers from the print or light of the world: for a lewd word escaped is irrevocable, but a bad or base discourse published in print is intolerable.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100280">Hereupon I have endured some conflicts between reason and judgement, whether it were convenient for the common wealth, with the indecorum of my calling (As some think it) that the memory of Tancred's tragedy should be again by my means, revived, which the oftener I read over, and the more I considered thereon, the sooner I was won to consent thereunto: calling to mind that neither the thrice reverend and learned father m. Beza, was ashamed in his younger years, to send abroad in his own name, his<pb facs="5"/> tragedy of Abraham, nor that rare scot (The scholar of our age) Buchanan, his most pathetical Jeptha. </p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100290">Indeed I must willingly confess this Worâ simple, and not worth comparison to any of theirs: for the writers of them were grave men; of this, young heads: in them is shown the perfection of their studies; in this, the imperfection of their wits. Nevertheless herein they all agree, commending virtue, detesting vice, and lively deciphering their overthrow that suppress not their unruly affections. These things noted herein, how simple soever the verse be, I hope the matter will be acceptable to the wise.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100300">Wherefore I am now bold to present Gismund to your sights, and unto yours only, for therefore have I conjured her, by the love that hath been these 24. years betwixt us, that she wax not so proud of her fresh painting, to straggle in her plumes abroad, but to contain herself within the walls of your house; so am I sure she shall be safe from the tragedian tyrants of our time, who are not ashamed to affirm that there can no amorous poem savour of any sharpness of wit, unless it be seasoned with scurrilous words.</p>
        <p xml:id="A15498-e100310">But leaving them to their lewdness, I hope you, and all discreet readers, will thankfully receive my pains, the fruits of my first harvest: the rather, perceiving that my purpose in this tragedy, tendeth only to the exaltation of virtue, and suppression of vice, with pleasure to profit and help all men, but to offend, or hurt no man. As for such as haâ neither the grace, nor the good gift to do well themselves, nor the common honesty, to speak well of others, I must (As I may) hear and bear their baitings with patience.</p>

Into this vault when she was one day descended (For the conveyance of her lover) her father in the mean season (Whose only joy was in his daughter) came to her chamber, and not finding her there, supposing her to have been walked abroad for her disport, he threw him down on her bed, and covered his head with a curtain, minding to abide and rest there till her return.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
