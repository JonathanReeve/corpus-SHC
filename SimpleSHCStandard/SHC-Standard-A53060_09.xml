           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

But put the case a man had the power of the whole world, and could quit that power for the enjoyment of any particular woman, or women, yet he quits not that power for the woman's sake, but for his minds-sake, his pleasure-sake, as to satisfy his fancy, passion, or appetites: and what conquest soever women make on men, if any conquest they do make, is more by the favour of nature, than the gods.</p>

              <speaker>Tranquill.</speaker>
              <p xml:id="A53060_09-e103540">First, as for themselves, if they would consider: for they must consider before they preach, which is, to teach: if they would consider, I say, how frail the parts of mankind are, how tender and weak every part of the body is, how apt they are to sickness and diseases, how they are subject more to pain than to pleasure, how difficult it is to keep the body from harm, how soon the body withers, decays, and dies: if mankind did consider this of the body, they would study what was the guard, and the preservation of every part of the body; in which study they would find temperance the only preservation of parts, and life of pleasure: for in excess pleasure dies, and pains possess the body. Thus we can destroy the body sooner by excess, and preserve it longer by temperance, than otherwise it would be.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_09-e103550">Secondly, for those that are married, temperance keeps both man and wise chaste, patient, and healthful, because gluttony, debauchery, and intemperate anger, hurts the body, and destroys the body. Thus temperance keeps the place of wedlock: for a wife being patient, the husband lives peaceably, being chaste, he lives honourably, being healthful, he lives comfortably; and the husband, being temperate, he will neither be a glutton, a drunkard, an adulterer, nor gamester: for gaming hurts the body, with vexing at the losses, and sitting still, which hinders the exercise of the body, or keeping unseasonable hours, which is pernicious to the health of the body, as to the quiet of the mind, and waste of their estates. Thus a man and wife lives free from jealousies and fear of poverty</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_09-e103560"><pb facs="162" n="300"/>Thirdly, for their neighbours: if they be temperate, they will neither be covetous, quarrelsome, nor envious, which will keep them from doing injury or wrong, and will cause them to be friendly and kind: for if they covet not their neighbours' goods, they will not strive to possess their neighbours right; if they be not envious, they will be sociable, and helpful to each other, as good neighbours ought to be: thus they will not vex each other with lawsuits, and quarrelling disputes, nor adulteries, and the like: and if men live peaceably, it is good for the commonwealth, as being free from faction and tumult: besides, peace and love are the ground whereon all the commands of the gods are built on.</p>

O that lane, that fortunate or unfortunate lane! for as my wishes succeed, the lane proves good or bad: for since that time of meeting, I have loved you, or rather, I may say, I have been in love with you, or rather, I may say, I have fancied you beyond all other young gentlemen, and I hope you will return the like to me: for though I am not in my blooming beauty, yet I am not quite decayed, but there remains some fresh colour, wherewith a young gentleman may take delight; and let me tell you, the autumn is more pleasant than the spring, for the spring is raw and cold, the autumn is warm and comfortable: wherefore let me persuade you, sweet monsieur Frisk, to choose the autumnal fruits, and reject the springing buds, which are insipid and tasteless: ripe fruits are better than green, and winter-fruits more lasting than the fruits of the summer: stayed gravity is more happy to live with, than wild inconstancy; the wisdom of age is more profitable than the follies of youth; not that I say I'm old, nor pray think me not so, but that I am as wise as age can make me, and wisdom is not a portion that is given to every one, yet what wisdom I have, I will impart to you, sweet monsieur Frisk, you shall be the receiver; the treasurer, and the disposer; also with my wisdom I give my heart, with my heart I give you my person, which wisdom, heart, and person, is not to be despised: for by my wisdom you will receive counsel, with my heart love, and with my person that beauty time hath left me, who like a cheating knave, hath robbed me of some, but yet there is enough left, dear monsieur Frisk, to delight your view: for although I am not like Helen of Greece, yet I am like Helen, when she was Helen of Troy, for then, by my faith, she was in her autumnal years, as I am, which was about fifty, or by'r lady, somewhat more, and then she was as dear to her Paris, witness Troy, and as much desired of her of .... witness the Greeks, as when she was but fifteen. Wherefore, dear Frisk, let me be thy Helen, and be thou my Paris, and let our loves be as bright as the fire of Troy, but not so consuming; but if thou deny'st me, I shall consume in mine own flames, and be buried in mine own ashes, which will fly in the face of thy cruelty, to revenge me thy</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
