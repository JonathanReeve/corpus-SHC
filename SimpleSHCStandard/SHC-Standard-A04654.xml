           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

So short-lived are the bodies of all things, in comparison of their souls. And, though bodies oft-times have the ill luck to be sensually preferred, they find afterwards, the good fortune (When souls live) to be utterly forgotten. This it is hath made the most royal princes, and greatest persons, (Who are commonly the personaters of these actions) not only studious of riches, and magnificence in the outward celebration, or show; (Which rightly becomes them) but curious after the most high, and hearty inventions, to furnish the inward parts: (And those grounded upon antiquity, and solid learnings) which, though their voice be taught to sound to present occasions, their sense, or doth, or should always lay hold on more removed mysteries.

These, therefore, were tropically brought in, before marriage, as disturbers of that mystical body, and the rites, which were soul unto it; that afterwards, in marriage, being dutifully tempted by her power, they might more fully celebrate the happiness of such as live in that sweet union, to the harmonious laws of nature, and reason.</note> humours, and four affections, all gloriously attired, distinguished only,<pb facs="5"/> by their several ensigns, and colours; and, dancing out on the stage, in their return, at the end of their dance, drew all their swords, offered to encompass the altar, and disturb the ceremonies. at which Hymen troubled, spoke,</p>

        <p xml:id="A04654-e105560">Hitherto extended the first night's solemnity, whose grace in the execution left not where to add unto it, with wishing: I mean, (Nor do I court them) in those, that sustained the nobler parts. Such was the exquisite performance, as (Beside the pomp, splendour, or what we may<pb facs="17"/> call apparrelling of such presentments) that alone (Had all else been absent) was of power to surprise with delight, and steal away the spectators from themselves. Nor was there wanting whatsoever might give to the furniture, or compliment: either in riches, or strangeness of the habits, delicacy of dances, magnificence of the scene, or divine rapture of music. Only the envy was, that it lasted not still, or (Now it is passed) cannot by imagination, much less description, be recovered to a part of that spirit, it had in the gliding by.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105570">Yet, that I may not utterly defraud the reader of his hope, I am drawn to give it those brief touches, which may leave behind some shadow of what it was: and first of the attires. </p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105580">That, of the lords, had part of it (For the fashion) taken from the antique Greek statue; mixed with some modern additions: which made it both graceful, and strange. On their heads they wore Persic crowns, that were with scrolls of gold-plate turned outward; and wreathed about with a carnation and silver net-lawn: the one end of which hung carelessly on the left shoulder, the other was tricked up before in several degrees of folds, between the plates, and set with rich jewels, and great pearl. Their bodies were of carnation cloth of silver, richly wrought, and cut to express the naked, in manner of the Greek thorax; girt under the breasts, with a broad belt of cloth of gold, embroidered, and fastened before<pb facs="17"/> with jewels: their labels were of white cloth of silver, laced, and wrought curiously between, suitable to the upper half of their sleeves; whose nether parts, with their bases, were of watchet cloth of silver, chevroned all over with lace. Their mantles were of several coloured silks, distinguishing their qualities, as they were coupled in pairs; the first, sky colour; the second, pearl colour; the third, flame colour; the fourth, tawny; and these cut in leaves, which were subtly tacked up, and embroidered with o's, and between every rank of leaves, a broad silver lace. They were fastened on the right shoulder, and fell compass down the back in gracious folds, and were again tied with a round knot, to the fastening of their swords. Upon their legs they wore silver greaves, answering in work to their labels; and these were their accoutrements. </p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105590">The ladies attire was wholly new, for the invention, and full of glory; as having in it the most true impression of a celestial figure: the upper part of white cloth of silver, wrought with Juno's birds and fruits; a loose under garment, full-gathered, of carnation, stripped with silver, and parted with a golden zone; beneath that, another flowing garment, of watchet cloth of silver, laced with gold: through all which, though they were round, and swelling, there yet appeared some touch of their delicate lineaments, preserving the sweetness of proportion, and expressing itself beyond expression. The attire of their heads,<pb facs="18"/> did answer, if not exceed; their hair being carelessly (But yet with more art, then if more affected) bound under the circle of a rare, and rich coronet, adorned with all variety, and choice of jewels; from the top of which, flowed a transparent veil down to the ground; whose verge, returning up, was fastened to either side in most sprightly manner. Their shoes were azure, and gold, set with rubies, and diamonds; so were all their garments: and every part abounding in ornament.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105600">No less to be admired, for the grace, and greatness, was the whole machine of the spectacle, from whence they came: the first part of which was a<seg xml:lang="unk" xml:id="A04654-e105610"> 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉</seg>, or globe, filled with countries', and those guilded; where the sea was expressed, heightened with silver waves. This stood, or rather hung, (For no axle was seen to support it) and turning softly, discovered the first masque, (As we have before, but too runningly declared) which was of the men, sitting in fair composition, within a mine of several metals: to which, the lights were so placed, as no one was seen; but seemed, as if only reason, with the splendour of her crown, illumined the whole grot.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105620">On the sides of this (Which began the other part) were placed two great statues, feigned of gold, one of Atlas, the other of Hercules, in varied postures, bearing up the clouds, which were of relief, embossed, and tralucent, as naturals: to<pb facs="18"/> these, a curtain of painted clouds joined, which reached to the upmost roof of the hall; and suddenly opening, revealed the three regions of air: in the highest of which, sat Juno, in a glorious throne of gold, circled with comets, and fiery meteors, engendered in that hot and dry region; her feet reaching to the lowest, where was made a rainbow, and within it, musicians seated, figuring airy spirits, their habits various, and resembling the several colours, caused in that part of the air by reflection. The midst was all of dark and condensed clouds, as being the proper place where rain, hail, and other watery meteors are made; out of which two concave clouds, from the rest, thrust forth themselves (In nature of those nimbi, wherein, by Homer, Virgil, etc. the gods are feigned to descend) and these carried the eight ladies, over the heads of the two<note anchored="true" n="a" place="margin" xml:id="A04654-e105630">Atlas, and Hercules, the figures mentioned before.</note> terms; who (As the engine moved) seemed also to bow themselves (By virtue of their shadows) and discharge their shoulders of their glorious burden: when, having set them on the earth, both they, and the clouds gathered themselves up again, with some rapture of the beholders. </p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105640">But that, which (As above in place, so in the beauty) was most taking in the spectacle, was the sphere of fire; in the top of all, encompassing the air, and imitated with such art, and industry, as the spectators might discern the motion (All the time the shows lasted) without any mover: and, that so swift, as no eye could distinguish any colour<pb facs="19"/> of the light, but might form to itself five hundred several hues, out of the tralucent body of the air, objected betwixt it, and them.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105650">And this was crowned with a statue of Jupiter, the thunderer. </p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105660">The design, and act of all which, together with the device of their habits, belongs properly to the merit, and reputation of master Inigo Jones; whom I take modest occasion, in this fit place, to remember, lest his own worth might accuse me of an ignorant neglect from my silence.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105670">And here, that no man's deservings complain of injustice (Though I should have done it timelier, I acknowledge) I do for honour's sake, and the pledge of our friendship, name ma. Alphonso Ferabosco, a man, planted by himself, in that divine sphere; and mastering all the spirits of music: to whose judicial care, and as absolute performance, were committed all those difficulties both of song, and otherwise. Wherein, what his merit made to the soul of our invention, would ask to be expressed in tunes, no less ravishing than his. Virtuous friend, take well this abrupt testimony, and think whose it is: it cannot be flattery, in me, who never did it to great ones; and less than love, and truth it is not, where it is done out of knowledge. </p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105680">The dances were both made, and taught by master Thomas Giles; and cannot be more approved, than they did themselves: nor do I want the will, but the skill to commend such subtleties;<pb facs="19"/> of which the sphere, wherein they were acted, is best able to judge.</p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105690">What was my part, the faults here, as well as the virtues must speak. <quote xml:id="A04654-e105700">Mutare dominum nec potest libre notus.</quote></p>
        <p xml:id="A04654-e105710">On the next night, whose solemnity was of barriers, (All mention of the former, being utterly removed, and taken away) there appeared, at the lower end of the hall, a mistress made of delicate perfumes; out of which (A battle being sounded under the stage) did seem to break forth two ladies, the one representing truth, the other opinion: but both so alike attired, as they could by no note, be distinguished. The colour of their garments were blue, their socks white; they were crowned with wreathes of palm, and in their hands, each of them sustained a palm-bough. These, after the mist was vanished, began to examine each other curiously with their eyes, and approaching the state, the one expostulated the other in this manner.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
