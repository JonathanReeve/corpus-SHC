           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Other country men have thought the like worthy of Dukes and prince's acceptations; iniusti sdegnij; il Pentamento Amorose; Calisthe, Pastorfido, etc. (All being but plays) were all dedicate to princes of Italy. And therefore only discourse to show my love to your right virtuous and noble disposition; this poor comedy (Of many desired to see printed) I thought not utterly unworthy that affectionate design in me: well knowing that your free judgement weighs nothing by the name, or form; or any vain estimation of the vulgar; but will accept acceptable matter, as well in plays; as in many less materials, masking in more serious titles. And so, till some work more worthy I can select, and perfect, out of my other studies, that may better express me; and more fit the gravity of your ripe inclination, I rest.</p>

But she hath so possessed my brother's heart with vows, and disavowings, sealed with oaths of second nuptials; as in that confidence, he hath invested her in all his state, the ancient inheritance of our family: and left my nephew and the rest to hang upon her pure devotion; so as he dead, and she matching (As I am resolved she will) with some young prodigal; what must ensue, but her post-issue beggared, and our house already sinking, buried quick in ruin. But this trial may remove it, and since 'tis come to this; mark but the issue Lycus, for all these solemn vows, if I do not make her prove in the handling as weak as a wafer; say I lost my time in travail.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
