           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

This had the happiness to please, as it was means, the greater part, and of them not the worst. If there be discovery made of the coniuring words, you'll find the witchcraft: no true spirit will be stirred with 'em; haply, a malicious. It was made more for the eye, than the ear; less for the hand, then either: and had not false copies travailed abroad (Even to surbating) this had kept in; for so far the author was from seeking fame in the publishing, that he could have wished it bound about with the King. Some good words here you shall find for your money, else it keeps not touch with the title. Receive it well, and though in this he give you no ill, yet hereafter he hath promised you better language.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
