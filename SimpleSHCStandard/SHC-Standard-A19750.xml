           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A19750-e100070">Courteous reader, the ancient Latin adage is, sultorum, but I say nebulonum plena sunt omnia, knaves be about all persons, and in all places. There are twelve coat-cards in the bunch, of which four are knaves, heart, diamond, spade, club, suiting with the four c c c c: court, city, country, camp: my purpose is not to touch any in particular; only thus much of them in general: some are notable, some notorious, some pimping, some panderly knaves; some prating, some pestilent; some cozening, some coney-catching knaves. There are also lazy and lying, base, and deboist, fantastical, foolish, and false knaves. To these we may add heretical and hypocritical, schismatical, and separistical knaves: not forgetting perjured, and shameless; impudent, and informing; arrogant, and arrant knaves, cum multis alijs. And besides these, I have heard of a knave tapster, a knave ostler, a knave sergeant, and a knave broker: but with these we have nothing to do at this time; only with a knave in grain, or a knave new vampt, in deciphering of whom, I give all the rest this caveat, have amongst you my masters: and now if any of the rest shall find himself touched, he hath his mends in his own hands, for he cannot say but I gave him fair warning. And so much of the argument, the act follows.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
