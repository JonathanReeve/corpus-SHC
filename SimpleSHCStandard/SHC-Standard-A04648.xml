           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

          <head>Asper his character.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100530">He is of an ingenious and free spirit, eager and constant in reproof, without fear controlling the world's abuses; one whom no servile hope of gain, or frosty apprehension of danger, can make to be a parasite, either to time, place, or opinion. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100540">
          <head>Macilente.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100550">A man well parted, a sufficient scholar, and travailed; who (Wanting that place in the world's account, which he thinks his merit capable of) falls into such an envious apoplexy, with which his judgement is so dazzled and distasted, that he grows violently impatient of any opposite happiness in another.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100560">
          <head>Puntarvolo.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100570">A vainglorious knight, over-englishing his travels, and wholly consecrated to singularity; the very Jacob's staff of compliment: a sir that hath lived to see the revolution of time in most of his apparel. Of presence good enough, but so palpably affected to his own praise, that (For want of flatterers) he commends himself to the floutage of his own family. He deals upon returns, and strange performances, resolving (In despite of public derision) to stick to his own particular fashion, phrase, and gesture. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100580">
          <head>Carlo Buffone.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100590">A public scurrilous, and profane jester; that (More swift than Circe) with absurd similes will transform any person into deformity. A<pb facs="3"/> good feast-hound or banket-beagell, that will sent you out a supper some three mile off, and swear to his patrons (God dam me) he came in oars when he was but wasted over in a sculler. A slave that hath an extraordinary gift in pleasing his palate, and will swill up more sack at a sitting, than would make all the guard a posset. His religion is railing, and his discourse ribaldry. They stand highest in his respect, whom he studies most to reproach.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100600">
          <head>Fastidius Briske.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100610">A neat, spruce, affecting courtier, one that wears clothes well, and in fashion; practiseth by his glass how to salute; speaks good remnants (Notwithstanding the bass-viol and tobacco:) swears tersely, and with variety, cares not what lady's favour he belies, or great man's familiarity: a good property to perfume the boot of a coach. He will borrow another man's horse to praise, and backs him as his own. Or for a need on foot can post himself into credit with his merchant, only with the jingle of his spur, and the jerk of his wand.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100620">
          <head>Deliro.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100630">A good doting citizen, who (It is thought) might be of the common counsel for his wealth: a fellow sincerely besotted on his own wife, and so rapt with a conceit of her perfections, that he simply holds himself unworthy of her. And in that hoodwinked humour, lives more like a suitor than a husband; standing in as true dread of her displeasure, as when he first made love to her. He doth sacrifice twopence in juniper to her every morning before sherises, and wakes her with villanous-out-of-tune music, which she out of her contempt (Though not out of her judgement) is sure to dislike.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100640">
          <head>Fallace.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100650">Deliro's wise and idol, a proud mincing peat, and as perverse as he is officious, she dotes as perfectly upon the courtier, as her husband doth 〈◊〉 her, and only wants the face to be dishonest.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100660">
          <head>Saviolina.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100670">A court lady, whose weightiest praise is a light wit, admired by herself and one more, her servant brisk. </p>

          <head>Sordido.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100690">A wretched hobnailed chuff, whose recreation, is reading of almanacs; and felicity, foul weather. One that never prayed, but for a lean dearth, and ever wept in a fat harvest. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100700">
          <head>Fungoso.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100710">The son of Sordido, and a student: one that has revealed in his time, and follows the fashion afar off like a spy. He makes it the whole bent of his endeavours to wring sufficient means from his wretched father, to put him in the courtiers cut: at which he earnestly aims, but so unluckily, that he still lights short a suit. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100720">
          <head>Sogliardo.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100730">An essential clown, brother to Sordido, yet so enamoured of the name of a gentleman, that he will have it though be buys it. He comes up every. Term to learn to take tobacco and see new motions. He is in his kingdom when he can get himself into company, where he may be well laughed at.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="character_description" xml:id="A04648-e100740">
          <head>Shift.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100750">A threadbare shark. One that never was soldier, yet lives upon lendings. His profession is skeldering and odling, his bank Paul's, and his Warehouse Pickt-hatch. Takes up single testons upon oaths till doom's day. Falls under executions of three shillings, and enters into five groat bonds. He way-layes the reports of services, and cons them without book, damning himself be came new from them, when all the while he was taking the diet in a bawdy house, or lay pawned in his chamber for rent and victuals. He is of that admirable and happy memory, that he will salute one for an old acquaintance, that he never saw in his life before. He usurps upon cheats, quarrels, and robberies, which he never did, only to get but a name. His chief exercises are taking the whiff, squiring a cockatrice, and making privy searches for imparters. </p>

          <head>Clove and Orenge.</head>
          <p xml:id="A04648-e100770">An inseparable case of coxcombs, city-born; the gemini or twins of 〈…〉 of better rank (To avoid the suspect of insufficiency) will enforce their ignorance most desperately, to set upon the understanding of any thing. Orange is the more humorous of the two (Whose small portion of juice (Being squeezed out) Clove serves to stick him with commendations.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
