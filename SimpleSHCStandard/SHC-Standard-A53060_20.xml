           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

              <p xml:id="A53060_20-e102960">But let me tell you, that those women that have inheritary honours, although not sovereigns, may endue their husbands with the same honour: but it is not generally so; but his children begotten on her are endued, and not the husband, yet some husbands are. As for example; a lord, vicount, Earl, marquis, Duke, King, or emperor, if the honour, as title, goeth to the female, for default of a male, in some nations their husbands are endued with their titles, but not commonly known to be so in England; as a wife with her husband, which is only during life, and not inhereditary: but if their titles are only during life, and not inhereditary, it cannot derive to another, that is not an successor's for inhereditary honour go like entailed lands, it goeth only to the next heir; but those that are the dignified, are like those that have jointures, or annuitles for life; so when a husband receives a dignity from a wife, or a wife from a husband, it is but so much honour for life.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
