           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

And do not weeds creep up first in all gardens? and why not then in this? which never was a garden until now; and which will be the garden of gardens, I foresee't.

What have I to do with him? when I send for him, let him come to me. That he is upon a point of discovery in a most excellent project for the weeding of this garden? what garden? what project? A project he says here for the good of the republic, repudding. This fellow has in stead of brains, a cobweb in his noddle, with little straws, feathers, and wings of dead butterflies hanging in it, that having motion by his airy fancy, there dance and keep a racket; 'tis to teach women silence, or some such foolish impossibility. He is ambitious to be called into authority by notice taken of some special service he is able to do the tate aforehand. But what great service he is able to do it, or which way to undertake it, falls not in the reach of my imagination. But good Mr. Croswill, by your favour now, what reason have you to slight or wrangle at this man? this honest cockbrayne? that has always been a constant friend to you, and officious in many good ways, and is a gentleman, not only of good descent and estate, but of a good disposition. And you two, Mr. Crosswill, by your leave, have always agreed like<pb facs="141" n="78"/> neighbours' children. Ay, the devil was in't, and now he vexes me again; we agreed in one point so well, that we have undone a couple of our children by it, and hindered the getting of I know not how many more. His son and my daughter should have married. And on a sudden he and I both consented to a dislike of the match and broke it, and have both repented it an hundred times since. We agree very well in that point; and now is his son irrecoverably lost, and my daughter resolutely bent to be an ape-leader in limbo. But what's all this to the affliction I suffer in my sons now? that one of them from a riotous boy. should grow into a puritanical woodcock; and the tother from a civil well-qualified fellow, turned absolute ruffian. There, there, I there's the devil in't. I could beat myself for getting such children.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
