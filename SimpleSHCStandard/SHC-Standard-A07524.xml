           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A07524-e100120">The fashion of playmaking, I can properly compare to nothing, so naturally, as the alteration in apparel: for in the time of the great-crop-doublet, your huge bombasted plays, quilted with mighty words to lean purpose was only then in fashion. And as the doublet fell, neater inventions began to set up. Now in the time of spruceness, our plays follow the niceness of our garments, single plots, quaint conceits, lecherous jests, dressed up in hanging sleeves, and those are fit for the times, and the termers: such a kind of light-colour summer stuff, mingled with divers colours, you shall find this published comedy, good to keep you in an afternoon from dice, at home in your chambers; and for venery you shall find enough, for sixpence, but well couched and you mark it. For Venus being a woman passes through the play in doublet and breeches, a brave disguise and a safe one, if the statute untie not her codpiece point. The book I make no question, but is fit for many of your companies, as well as the person itself, and may be allowed both gallery room at the playhouse, and chamber-room at your lodging: worse things I must needs confess the world<pb facs="3"/> has taxed her for, then has been written of her; but 'tis the excellency of a writer, to leave things better than he finds 'em; though some obscene fellow (That cares not what he writes against others, yet keeps a mystical bawdy-house himself, and entertains drunkards, to make use of their pockets, and vent his private bottle-ale at midnight) though such a one would have ripped up the most nasty vice, that ever hell belched forth, and presented it to a modest assembly; yet we rather wish in such discoveries, where reputation lies bleeding, a slackness of truth, than fullness of slander.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
