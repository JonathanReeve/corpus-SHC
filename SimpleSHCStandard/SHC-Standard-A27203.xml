           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Fletcher, as we shall your favourable acceptance, and encouragement in it. The play was of so general a received acceptance, that (He himself a spectator) we have known him unconcerned, and to have wished it had been none of his; he, as well as the thronged theatre (In despite of his innate modesty) applauding this rare issue of his brain. His complacency in his own work, may be, perhaps no argument to you of the goodness of the play, any more than our confidence of it; and we do not expect our encomium can do any thing with you, when the play itself is so near: that will commend itself unto you. And now farewell our glory! Farewell your choice delight, most noble gentlemen! Farewell th' grand wheel that set us smaller motions in action! Farewell the pride and life o'th' stage!

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
