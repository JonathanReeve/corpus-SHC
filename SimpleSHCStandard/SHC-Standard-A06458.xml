           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A06458-e100080">Gentlemen, inductions are out of date, and a prologue in verse is as stale, as a black velvet cloak, and a bay garland: therefore you shall have it plain prose thus: if there be any amongst you, that come to hear lascivious scenes, let them depart: for I do pronounce this, to the utter discomfort of all two penny gallery men, you shall have no bawdry in it: or if there be any lurking amongst you in corners, with table books, who have some hope to find fit matter to feed his â€” malice on, let them clasp them up, and slink away, or stay and be converted. For he that made this play, means to please auditors so, as he may be an auditor himself hereafter, and not purchase them with the dear loss of his ears: I dare not call it comedy, or tragedy; 'tis perfectly neither: a play it is, which was meant to make you laugh, how it will please you, is not written in my part: for though you should like it today, perhaps yourselves know not how you should digest it tomorrow: some things in it you may meet with, which are out of the common road: a Duke there is, and the scene lies in Italy, as those two<pb facs="3"/> things lightly we never miss. But you shall not find in it the ordinary and overworn trade of jesting at lords and courtiers, and citizens, without taxation of any particular or new vice by them found out, but at the persons of them: such, he that made this, thinks vile; and for his own part vows, that he did never think, but that a lord born might be a wise man, and a courtier an honest man.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
