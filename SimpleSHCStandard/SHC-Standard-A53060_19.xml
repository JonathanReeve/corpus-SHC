           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

But when our lord general who was recovered out of sickness, and all his commanders about him heard this message, which was delivered in a full assembly, according as the lady Victoria had commanded the message should be, the men could not choose but smile at the women's high and mighty words, knowing they had all sweet and gentle dispositions and complying natures, yet they were at a stand which to be pleased at most, as in hearing them disparage their masculine sex, or in advancing their own female sex by their self commendations, but howsoever so well pleased the men were with the women's gallant actions, that every man was proud that had but a female acquaintance in the female army; but our lord general was mightily taken with their bravadoes, and much mirth amongst the commanders was about it; but when they were to advise what to do in the affairs of war, and the warring women, the general told them he made no question but that most men known by experience that women were won by gentle persuasions and fair promises, and not by rigid actions or angry frowns, besides said he, all noble natures strive to assist the weakest in all lawful actions, and that he was no gallant man that submits not to a woman in all things that are honourable, and when he doth dissent it must be in a courtly manner, and a complimental behaviour and expression, for that women were creatures made by nature, for men to love and admire, to protect and defend, to cherish and maintain, to seek and to sue to, and especially such women which have outdone all their sex, which nature ever made before them; wherefore said he, 'tis fit to these women above all others we should yield ourselves prisoners, not only in love but in arms; wherefore let us treat fairly with them, and give them their own<pb facs="321" n="613"/> conditions. But in the mean time the lady Victoria thought it best not to lose my opportunity with talking out the time, wherefore she besieged a considerable fort, a place which was at it were the key that unlocked the passage into the heart of the enemy's kingdom, and at this siege they were when became away, but the general and his council had sent a messenger unto them, but what his message was I cannot give you an account.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
