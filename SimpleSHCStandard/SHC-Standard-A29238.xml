           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Thou shalt find allthings saleable in Troynovant; the dainty dames will untie thy purse strings with a buss: out goes the husband, in comes the friend; hah, hah, hah. Thou shalt find some that resign their offices lest they should lose them; others leaving their nest, that thy and their young may not perish, others that abounded through rapine miserably exhausted; others adorned with others feathers, that have cast their own. Here thou shalt see cobblers and hucksters that rise out of old shoes and panniers, beating the pulpit, and broaching new doctrines, as if they were regij professores, and held by the rabble to be most profound divinity: yea, I cannot wash my hands but methinks I see the soapy effigies of Brunfield in the basin âª nor can I go down into a cellar, but I find the lively statue of master Abel; yea I cannot, untie my shoe, but I call to mind that patent for leather and deride it; for men now truly seem turned into trees bringing forth spacious branches, but fruits of vanity: in a word all the world is full of fools, and ridiculous in the eyes of Democritus. </p>

In which, I say, how wretchedly have you erred? For you were judges, and censurers of the self same crime, whereof you were the authors. For a judge to take a bribe, was a capital thing; but if so great and so heavy a sentence was pronounced for one fault, and that extending but to a particular subject, what punishment must be inflicted on them, who have been so injurious to the subjects, of a whole flourishing island; by making the prince suspicious of his subjects: the subjects of their prince; by declaring new opinions against the evident testimonies of their consciences; by perturbing the halcyon days of a peaceful King, and an obedient state; yea by bringing all according to their power, into flames and ashes; if such a fire whereof you were the true incendiarys, do not deserve death, what it better deserveth I cannot tell. The law was first ordained to be a public benefit; but by you it<pb facs="15"/> is made the very plague of the common weal; you have all very well acted the part of Midas: being commissaries of trust between prince and people, which you should not violate for threatenings, friends, entreaties nor rewards; you being enticed by the bail of avarice, or strucken with a panic fear, have left justice naked; and wretchedly neglected your consciences, which testified against you.

Which short conflict being ended, like barbarians as they were, they showed themselves most savage, and tyrannous conquerors: nor in that extreme cruelty, did they show themselves more implacable towards any condition, then to men of the consular dignity, thinking that through their eloquent and vendible tongues, the Romans had first beleagued them, and brought them to that calamity. Varus prosecutes them with the same mind and fate of Paulus at Cannae, never was greater slaughter in fields and woods, never more intolerable insultation,<pb facs="16"/> but especially towards those that pleaded causes. Some of their eyes pulled out, others hands cut off, one's mouth they sewed up, first cutting out his tongue, which a barbarian holding in his hand said, at length; viper desist from hissing, you should likewise call to mind Manius Acilius; that unsatisfied gulf of bribery, and principal ambassador of the Romans, whom Mithridates with great contempt, compelled to ride upon an ass, until he came unto Pergamus, where he commanded elixir of gold to be thrust into his mouth, intimating that the Romans were to much given to briberies, and had tongues, too eloquent in evil speaking. Alexander Severus the greatest enemy of flatterers, commanded that Turinus one of his courtiers; should be tied to a stake in the market place, and smothered to death with smoke, having a crier proclaiming by him. Let him perish with smoke, that sold smoke: for it is better (To use Antisthenes' words) to fall amongst crows, than parasites; amongst crows to be devoured dead, then amongst parasites to be devoured living. Therefore it will be an argument of wisdom, for us to deal with you, who hath brought such plagues upon the commonweal, and disturbed our peace by your slanderous judgements, as Philip King of Macedon, did with two of his subjects, men of vile conditions; he commanded one to fly from Macedon, and the other to follow him, which being done, his country was purged of such noxious sycophants: both departed but neither of them returned.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
