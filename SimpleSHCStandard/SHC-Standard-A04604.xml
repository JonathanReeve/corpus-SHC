           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <head>To the right honourable, the right worshipful and others his friends and Musophilus: Eugenius wisheth pierian love, benevolent aspect, and candid censure.</head>
        <p xml:id="A04604-e100140">Having long since (Honoured gentlemen, and friends) finished this play, and fitted it for the stage, I intended to have had there the Promethean fire of action infused into it: being thereto encouraged by the general good liking and content, which many of you vouchsafed to receive in the hearing of it; which way it never yet miscarried, but still had all that the ear could give it: and with whom some prime wits of both the universities, and those that were learned in this faculty (Competent judges enough) have in their free and open censures unanimously accorded. This I say was encouragement enough for me to prefer this little glow-worm (Which I had, as yet, only fostered and kept warm with mine own breath) to the stage, and to bring it into that noble nursery of action, where dramatic poems usually and rightly take their degrees of applause from them that can best judge, the spectators; that, as it had been before only demissa per aurem, it might be now at length oculis subjecta fidelibus. But the players,<pb facs="3"/> upon a slight and half view of it, refused to do it that right; the reason I well know not, unless perhaps it had not in it so much witchcraft in poëtry, as, now 'tis known, the stage will bear. Be what will, it hath again been under the file since they saw it: and now by the earnest impulse of some particular friends, necessity concurring, myself also willing to avoid farther trouble and care for it, that it might not hinder the conception of things more worthy your care and sight; I was, unwillingly, forced to publish it to the world; where being freely exposed to all censures, I doubt not but many a dog-toothed cynic will have a snap at it: but I know already they will not be worth my anger, and therefore should be loath to spend any part of my title upon them; only I wish them to note this saying well:<quote xml:id="A04604-e100150"><l xml:id="A04604-e100160">Another's work to reprehend</l><l xml:id="A04604-e100170">How easy 'tis? how hard to mend? </l></quote></p>
        <p xml:id="A04604-e100180">In the mean time I do submit it wholly to the learned judgements of you all (Gentlemen) for whose delight it was conceived and written; to you do I repair both for defence and candour: hoping that you will vindicate this harmless piece from the rash censures of malevolent and unskilful judges, whilst I take leave to say;<quote xml:id="A04604-e100190"><l xml:id="A04604-e100200">—<note anchored="true" n="*" place="margin" xml:id="A04604-e100210">ambubaiarum collegii alumni.</note> demetri teque Tigelli,</l><l xml:id="A04604-e100220">Discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras. </l></quote>what though it was never acted? I hold the deep and solid ear a more faithful messenger to the understanding, than the eye: grave auditors are still welcomer to the Muses, than light spectators: such I mean as applaud only of toys and babbles (Poscentes vestro multum diversa palato) are like Americans merely taken with bells, rattles, and hobby-horses,<pb facs="3"/> not relishing the perfection of nature nor solid art, though industry labour to feed them with both at once. But this excuse is left for them: invincible ignorance satisfies before God and man. This hope remains to us, non omnes eadem mirantur amantque what though it never took the degree of the stage? I presume you are all learned (Gentlemen) and know better how to judge by the care, than by the eye, though both may exercise their functions here: as well a fool as a good physician may come from Padua: and an ass may graduate himself at Athens. Wherefore now (Gentlemen) if you be lovers of the Muses (And such I would have you all) I need not then doubt of your benevolent aspects, which will soon beget a candid censure. I make but one Musophilus of you all, to whom (As it were) Uno in multis, I dedicate my endeavours bestowed upon this poem, hoping to find in you all, severally, that fundamental similitude and common ration in your loves to learning, by which you may easily retribute that recompense to these labours, which the stage denied</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
