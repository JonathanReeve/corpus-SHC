           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

They have been at high words, and so high, that the ground could not serve them, but (For want of chopins) have stalked upon stages.</p>
        <p xml:id="A20081-e100300">Horace haled his poetasters to the bar, the poetasters untrussed Horace: how worthily either, or how wrongfully, (World) leave it to the jury: Horace (Questionless) made himself believe, that his Burgonian wit might desperately challenge all comers, and that none durst take up the foils against him: it's likely, if he had not so believed, he had not been so deceived, for he was answered at his own weapon: and if before Apollo himself (Who is coronator poetarum) an inquisition should be taken touching this lamentable merry murdering of innocent poetry: all mount Helicon<pb facs="4"/> 〈…〉</p>
        <p xml:id="A20081-e100310">I could here (Even with the feather of my pen) wipe off other ridiculous imputations: but my best way to answer them, is to laugh at them: only thus much I protest (And swear by the divinest part of true poesy) that (Howsoever the limbs of my naked lines may be and I know have have been, tortured on the rack) they are free from conspiring the least disgrace to any man, but only to our new Horace; neither should this ghost of Tucca, have walked up and down Poule's churchyard, but that he was razed up (In print) by new exorcisms. World, if thy hugeness will believe this: do, if not, I care not: for I dedicate my book not to thy greatness, but to the greatness of thy scorn: defying which, let that mad dog Detraction<pb facs="4"/> bite till his teeth be worn to the stumps: envy feed thy snakes so fat with poison till they burst: world, let all thy adders shoot out their hydra-headed-forked stings, ha, ha, Nanci; if none will take my part, (As I desire none) yet I thank thee (Thou true Venusian Horace) for these good words thou givest me: populus me sibylat at mihi plaudo.

I recant, bear witness all you gentlefolks (That walk i'th galleries) I recant the opinions which I held of courtiers, ladies, and citizens, when once (In an assembly of friars) I railed upon them: that heretical libertine Horace, taught me so to mouth it. Besides, 'twas when stiff Tucca was a boy: 'twas not Tucca that railed and roared then, but the devil and his angels: but now, kings-truce, the captain summons a parley, and delivers himself and his prasing company into your hands, upon what composition you will. Are you pleased? and I'll dance friskin for joy, but if you be not, by th' lord I'll see you all — here for your two pence a piece again, before I'll lose your company. I know now some be come hither with cheeks swollen as big with hisses, as if they had the toothache: udsfoote, if I stood by them, I'd be so bold as — entreat them to hiss in another place. Are you advised what you do when you hiss? you blow away Horace's revenge: but if you set your<pb facs="49"/> hands and seals to this, Horace will write against it, and you may have more sport: he shall not lose his labour, he shall not turn his blank verses into waste paper: no, my poëtasters will not laugh at him, but will untruss him again, and again, and again. I'll tell you what you shall do, cast your little Tucca into a bell: do, make a bell of me, and be all you my clappers, upon condition, we may have a lusty peal, this cold weather: I have but two legs left me, and they are both yours: good night my two penny tenants God night.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
