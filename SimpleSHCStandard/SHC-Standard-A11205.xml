           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

The soul of man desires to be united with the divine essence from whence it is derived. 'tis then but reason that these poems should of themselves return to you, by whose influence they were conceived; both of them being born in your house: the one whilst I admired the serenity, and sweetness of your disposition: the other when I kept time with your grief, which you took for the loss of that noble lady, your dear wife: so that now I doubt whether I may call myself the author, or you. At least, if this be my work, I am yours: and<pb facs="3"/> could my capacity have reached those heroic virtues, which in the time of my attendance I beheld in you, I might perhaps have dared a higher flight, and from the humble strain of shepherds, have grown up to you, as you are, the subject of all moral virtues: I shouldh ha' then described your valour, industry, and prudence in your actions at sea, your bounty still exercised in the right place, your piety in the memory of your deceased lady, of whom, (Besides the monument you have erected to her,) the statues and pictures you have, and whatever else might render her, testify what a value you set on the original. Uxorem enim vivam amare voluptas est, defunctam religio. But these aims are too high for me, yet may you somewhat raise my thoughts, if you descend to keep these in your esteem, and with them,</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
