           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

And (So it be not mortal) it were but justice in her for so gross a scorn by him cast upon a well reputed gentleman. Yet is it observed in her that she has a violent humour to do, and not to do things oftentimes wilfully against all good council or persuasion, she has the spirit of contradiction in her, and an unalterable resolution upon sudden intentions, a most incorrigible will she has that will not bow nor break. This cross abusive letter therefore may do good upon her,<pb facs="28"/> however mischievous he might intend it. If she meant well to him before, it may the faster bring her on, but it amazes me that he should write so, bearing his uncle, and myself in hand, that he so fairly loved her, and besought us to negotiate with her for him, should she forgive it, yet the wrong to us in his vile manners is unpardonable, and so sir, I come to you.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
