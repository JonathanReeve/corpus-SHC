           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

This makes, that I now number you, not only in the names of favour, but the names of justice, to what I write; and do, presently, call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manliest virtue: as coveting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authority of a judge, than the credit of an undertaker. Read therefore, I pray you, and censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the simplicity of the first copy. And, when you shall consider, through the certain hatred of some, how much a man's innocency may be endangered by an uncertain accusation; you will, I doubt not, so begin to hate the iniquity of such natures, as I shall love the contumely done me, whose end was so honourable, as to be wiped off by your sentence.</p>

It shall fright all it friends, with borrowing letters, and when one of the fourscore hath brought it knighthood ten shillings, it knighthood shall go to the cranes, or the bear at the bridge-foot, and be drunk in fear: it shall not have money to discharge one tavern reckoning, to invite the old creditors, to forbear it knighthood; or the new, that should be, to trust it knighthood. It shall be the tenth name in the bond, to take up the commodity of pipkins and stone jugs; and the part thereof shall not furnish it knighthood forth, for the attempting of a baker's widow, a brown baker's widow. It shall give it knighthood's name, for a stallion, to all gamesome citizens' wives, and be refused; when the master of a dancing school, or (How do you call him) the worst reveller in the town is taken: it shall want clothes, and by reason of that, wit, to fool to lawyers. It shall not have hope to repair itself by Constantinople, Ireland, or Virginia; but the best, and last fortune to it knighthood shall be, to make Dol Tearsheet, or Kate-common, a lady: and so, it knighthood may eat.</p>

If you appear learned to an ignorant wench, or jocund to a sad, or witty to a foolish, why she presently begins to mistrust herself. You must approach them i' their own height, their own line: for the contrary makes many that fear to commit themselves to noble and worthy fellows, run into the embraces of a rascal. If she love wit, give verses, though you borrow 'em of a friend, or buy 'em, to have good. If valour, talk of your sword, and be frequent in the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If activity be seen o'your Barbary often, or leaping over stools, for the credit of your back. If she love good clothes or dressing have your learned counsel about you every morning, your French tailor, barber, linener, etc. Let your powder, your glass, and your comb, be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the ornament of your head, than the safety: and wish the commonwealth rather troubled, than a hair about you. That will take her. Then if she be covetous and craving, do you promise any thing, and perform sparingly: so shall you keep her in appetite still. Seem as you would give, but be like a barren field that yields little, or unlucky dice, to foolish, and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts be flight, and dainty, ra her then precious. Let cunning be above cost. Give cherries at time of year, or apricots; and say they were sent you out of the country, though you bought 'em in Cheapside. Admire her tires; like her in all fashions; compare her in every habit to some deity; invent excellent dreams to flatter her, and riddles; or, if she be a great one, perform always the second<pb facs="29"/> parts to her: like what she likes, praise whom she praises, and fail not to make the household and servants yours, yea the whole family, and salute 'em by their names: ('tis but light cost if you can purchase 'em so) and make her physician your pensioner, and her chief woman. Nor will it be out of your gain to make love to her too, so she follow, not usher, her lady's pleasure. All blabbing is taken away, when she comes to be a part of the crime.</p>

My father, in my education, was wont to advise me, that I should always collect, and contain my mind, not suffering<pb facs="45"/> it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not: embracing the one and eschewing the other. In short, that I should endear myself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be another nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings, or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things, that make for the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding of clamours, and impertinences of orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you you do not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what a torrent of evil! My very house turns round with the tumult! I dwell in a windmill! The perpetual about motion is here, and not at Eltham. </p>

Nay, sir Daw, and sir la-foole, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the favours! we are all thankful to you, and so should the womankind here, specially for lying on her, though not with her! You meant so, I am sure? But, that we have stuck it upon you today, in your own imagined persons, and so lately; this Amazon, the champion of the sex, should beat you now thriftily, for the common slanders, which ladies receive from such cuckoos, as you are. You are they, that when no merit or fortune can make you hope to enjoy their bodies, will yet lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away you common moths of these, and all ladies' honours, go, travail to make legs and faces,<pb facs="51"/> and come home with some new matter to be laughed at: you deserve to live in an air as corrupted, as that wherewith you feed rumour. Madames, you are mute, upon this new metamorphosis! but here stands she, that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such insectae hereafter. And let it not trouble you that you have discovered any mysteries to this young gentleman. He is (Almost) of years, and will make a good visitant within this twelvemonth. In the mean time, we'll all undertake for his secrecy, that can speak so well of his silence. Spectators, if you like this comedy, rise cheerfully, and now Morose is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noise will cure him, at least please him.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
