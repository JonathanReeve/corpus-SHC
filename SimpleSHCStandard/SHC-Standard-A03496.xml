           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Poeta's love indeed of late is much alienated from me, but as long I love him, I'll speak in his defence; did you see how Polites did only speak an accusation against him? and Ethicus abuse his froward age; and Oeconoma chafe out her weak conjecture? and then, (When they had rather showed the weakness of their age; then the strength of their reason,) flung away, as if their objections could not be answered, because they would not hear an answer. I would inquire of Polites (If my ancestors have not misinformed me in antiquity) whether in the time of Herodotus, and after that, of Zenophon (And since of many others) there has not been a like conjunction to Poeta's and Historia's; and whether your chiefest common-wealths-men, either of former times as Plato; or of later, as the great Solon of the utopian commonwealth, have not made a poetical invention their chiefest glory? but there is no discoursing with age; especially, when it is possessed with a perverse prejudice.</p>

I had almost forgotten the main point of the business: here — give that to Causidicus. A man may as well open an oyster without a knife, as a lawyer's mouth without a fee; but if he were half dead, that would (Like strong-water to a dying man) make him gape, though he could not speak. O the serpentine ingratitude of man! that these snakes, whom I have nourished in my bosom, should now sting me! This logicus, a base, dry-brained kecks-witted clinch-fist, not long ago, perceiving his fortunes to be brought to a desperate precipitation; through the incomprehensible difficulty of his artless curiosities, most fawningly embosoms himself into my acquaintance, upon a former consideration of my alluring faculty; and in the dusty terms of some cobweb eloquence, blunderingly stammered out his extreme, his extreme wants: for he had only so much enforced rhetoric, as to bring out those words twice, and so by chance light upon a sorry figure; then brutishly he expressed the rest, rather by crying then speaking; (And indeed he had no more moisture else in him, then only to bewail his own misery) when asking what was his request, he answered, that I would turn his unpleasant rules into pleasant verse: I straight out of the open freeness of my nature and an effuse goodness, prevented the repetition of his suit, by a quick consent; thereupon set myself a work, and after some travail performed it: some travail I say; for by the nine muses, I think I was above nine months in travail with that monstrous birth: if one but consider what<pb facs="17"/> splay-footed verses they were, a man would swear, that some infernal hag, not a muse (Though unwilling) had been the mother of them; which unhappy labour when I had showed unto him, the reviving wretch falls on's knees, admires the work, calls me the Aesculapius of his salvation, and with hands lifted up, vows to pay his vows at the muse's altar; that I now more admired at his admiration, then at the deformities of mine own work: for, by Jove, they are such unblessed, such unlucky verses, that, besides the loss of custom, which they may justly procure the author, they are able to make a man be suspected for a conjurer; there wants nothing but a circle to make a complete conjuration. <quote xml:id="A03496-e107810"><l xml:id="A03496-e107820">Fecana, Caieti, Dafenes, Hebare, Gedaco,</l><l xml:id="A03496-e107830">Gebali stant, non stant, febas, Hebas, Hecas. </l></quote>sure I think it should have been Hecate. Well, he enjoys them; and upon the happiness of this success came Grammaticus to me with the like suit: i'faith I did it, and cast most of his rules likewise into verse: but by Jove, since the proud schoolmaster has showed himself thus ungracious and stiffnecked towards me, I'll be even with him; and now I think on't, there's all his syntaxis yet to do; but by this hand, if ever I turn line of it into verse, let me hereafter be a mere heteroclite, and the very Aptoton of a fool per omnes casus. </p>

And there was also one Lucretius, a Roman gentleman, in former times that fell in love with Physica, she from whom Physica the mother of astronomia derives now both her name and lineage, which gentleman, in the passion of his love, writ books in the praise<pb facs="36"/> of her beauty; but what wrinkle-faced verses they are, let the present age judge; and if her beauty was like his lines, sure she was passed her threescore, when he fell in love with her; but alas, there was never any of that family that ever came near the historias for beauty.</p>

              <p xml:id="A03496-e126810">I do find myself at this present affected with that which should not touch a good magistrate, an unwillingness to do justice: yet I profess it proceeds not from a desire to be<pb facs="45"/> injurious, but merciful; not for an ill-will to either, but a love to both. Whilst heretofore, I understood of this dissension, as I was somewhat cast down with sorrow, so I was raised with an hope of happy reconcilement, but now that hope also which before was the cause of an uncertain joy, is become the ground of my most certain grief; and the rather to see the state of our most blessed commonwealth (Which the gods have decreed shall be eternal, if ourselves hinder not) to be thus torn with our civil discords. You are not ignorant of the miraculous means which the gods have used in raising us to this greatness: not by riches, but poverty; not by plenty, but want; that what to others has been the occasion of disgrace, has to us been the means of our present honour: it is the observation of the Grecians, Tacitus, and truest oracle of Greece, Thucydides, that the Athenians commonwealth was not raised to that glory (Like the rest of Greece) by the fruitfulness but barrenness of the soil: for which cause whilst the inhabitants lived secure from the invasion of borderers, others growing rich, were at last consumed by their own dissensions: so that for the avoiding of public disturbance, when any were afflicted, they retired to the Athenians, with what they had left, before all were lost; who as they did partake of the Athenians security, so mutually offered to the Athenians the participation of their wealth: the like I may say of our present estate; we have not sought unto others; yet who have not sought to us? we had nothing, yet what want we, unless it be a moderation of our felicity? All other mechanic faculties, of whatsoever corporations, have they not forsook themselves to retire to us? and yielded up their estates, which they thought unhappy, to receive them as an happiness from our bounty? I speak not these things unto you as an instructor, but a remembrancer: not to impose on you a new belief beyond your experience, but to imprint in your minds a just consideration of your dangerous contention. I have yet but begun to speak; but sorrow is a bad orator, and I must continue my speech with a silent rhetoric. <stage xml:id="A03496-e126820">He speaks this aside to Causid. </stage></p>

But for logicians, alas, (I must speak the truth) as their names were unknown, so were their endeavours buried in obscurity: indeed those times were thrifty, and active: but these, out of a wanton softness of a dainty sloth, do only spin out these spiderwebs of curiosity; and it hath been often my meditation, to have an amputation of such excrescencies, and to cause that our youth which is to be instructed for future use, should not consume the strength of their wits, in an injurious labour of fruitless vanities. I do not deny a just knowledge of your faculty, to be most necessary, and ourselves thereinto have an advantage of former times: but yet, alas! how many thousand famous orators have there been without logic? how many eternal poets without logic? whose divine eloquence could speak beyond all logic; without all logic. <stage xml:id="A03496-e127350">Enter musica.</stage></p>

And to observe the witty revenge of the gods; that this intended murder should come forth by mine own man Sanguis, from whom in policy I concealed it: well, I perceive blood is open-mouthed and will tell all: but since it is not much known, and that I am not as yet accused to Polites, and now requested to help astronomia, I'll take the happy occasion, and use my best art to cure her, and so if she scape, I may peradventure scape too; obtaining pardon for my recompense — let me see — by this water I do find the state of her body much altered, and her disease changed. There was an astronomia that I once had in cure before now, and she was of the very same constitution, had the like disease, and the like turning in her head; now she died, and afterwards we made a dissection in her head, to see what was the disaffection of her brain, which when we had done, we found all her brains turned to a matter much like clear jelly, or a crystalline orb: but I hope all such suspicions of this astronomia are fables — but stay — what's the relish of her urine? (He tastes it) — pah, naught, naught: o, who would be a physician to taste these things? 'tis worse than to be a saltpetre-man, and dig in a privy-house — but what smell has it? (He smells to it.) Foh, worse, worse, I cannot endure it, [he throws away the urinal, and breaks it.] Astronomia's of a fair complexion herself, I wonder that her urine should be so dark; 'tis of the colour of a cloud. Well, I see she's very corrupt within, and I fear 'tis this Astrologia has powdered her; to give her a potion at the mouth will not do much good; for 'twill be so long in descending, that the power of it will be much debilitated; I conclude then, it must be a clyster, a clyster; and so I'll in, to administer it: well, if I scape this scouring cleanly; I'll never come in the like pickle again, whilst I breathe. <stage xml:id="A03496-e127720">Exit medicus.</stage></p>

              <p xml:id="A03496-e128860">Why, sir, in our north-voyage being come to the utmost part in all Finmarchia, to the north-cape (The longitude thereof is well-nigh fifty degrees, and the latitude almost 73.) being then past the Arctic-circle about six degrees, and so by consequent being in a parallel sphere, Geographus durst not venture any further; and there was, sir, at that time in our company, a great magician (I have forgotten of what university) which magician and I, leaving Geographus upon the land, undertook (Being so near) to discover the parts directly under the pole.</p>

              <p xml:id="A03496-e128900">Why, sir, besides excellent furs we had, we had also hot waters to preserve our heat within: but at last we were come so far, that we were fain to come out of our<pb facs="50"/> ship upon the ice, and then the magician being also an exquisite geometrician, got the ship upon the ice, and then made wheels for it, and an artificial engine to make it go of itself; you may see proportionally the like device in your puppets that will go and turn of themselves. The ice then being smooth, the ship went forward of its own accord, till we found ourselves to have passed the Arctic circle twenty three degrees full. Then were we half a degree just from the pole: there we met with a most furious sea, that scorns to yield to the usurping cold; when the geometrician takes me off the wheels, and forth we launched, and so sailed till we came to have the pole itself for our zenith; and then we beheld a dreadful rock.</p>

              <p xml:id="A03496-e128940">Why thus, sir: when the magician saw this, he immediately draws a book out of his pocket, and falls to reading; when straightway all the sea about us was as calm as a fresh water river amongst us: and the ship went no faster than we would have it ourselves; and so without any danger we came to the rock; unto which making a shift to fasten our ship, we ascended: it seemed as black as any pitch: upon the top of which (For we went to the top) there ascended an huge pillar: which on the lower parts seemed as black as the rock; but still in the ascent it grew whiter, and whiter; and indeed the whole pillar seemed to us very ice, but that it was at the lower part blacker, and it was as big as ordinarily any tower among us; and at the bottom of it there was a passage to go in. We went in, and being entered, there were two pair of stairs, the one descending, the other ascending: for we found the pillar to be hollow, and our sight could not discover withoutside how high it was: we went down wards some dozen or twenty stairs, where we heard a most hideous noise, that our hearts failing us we came up again.</p>

              <p xml:id="A03496-e128980">No, sir, we then went onwards, and in our ascent we still found open places to give us light and air; as big commonly as a door; and we ascended so far, that at last the<pb facs="50"/> sun shined upon us, as it does here, and then it grieved us to think we were to go back such an uncouth way again; well, we went still higher, and at last looking out at these doors, and seeing that part of the world that lay towards us, (Being a fine sunshine day,) we saw a very terrible battle, fought between the Turk and the Persian, wherein the Turk was put to the worst: but now the magician growing weary, and desirous to know how far this pillar ascended, he held by the side of the door, and looked upwards, but with the fear suddenly fell down: and there was the unhappy end of my companion. This pillar doubtless we conjectured to be the pole, and the way to heaven; and the stairs that descended, the way to hell, and to the other pole. With this accident I being half affrighted, with a trembling at the wonders of the gods, humbly descended.</p>

Poeta, you shall give me leave, for conclusion of my speech, to usurp two verses, which I have heard you often speak.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
