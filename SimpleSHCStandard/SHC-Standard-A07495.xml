           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A07495-e100100">Too soon and too late, this work is published: too soon, in that it was in the press, before i had notice of it, by which means some faults may escape in the printing. Too late, for that it was not published when the general voice of the people had sealed it for good, and the newness of it made it much more desired, then at this time: for plays in this city are like wenches new fallen to the trade, only desired of your neatest gallants, whiles they are fresh: when they grow stale they must be vented by termers and country chapmen. I know not how this labour will please, sure i am it passed the censure of the stage with a general applause, now (Whether vox populi be vox dei or no) that I leave to be tried by the acute judgement of the famous six wits of the city: farewell.</p>

I remember a pretty wooden sentence in a preamble to an exercise, where the reader prayed: that men of his coat might grow up like cedars to make good wainscot in the house of sincerity, would not this wainscot phrase be writ in brass, to publish him that spoke it for an animal: why, such wooden pellets out of earthen trunks, do strike these females into admiration, hits 'em home, sometimes (Perhaps) in at one ear, and out at tother, and then they depart in opinion, wiser than their neighbours, fraught with matter, able to take down and mortify their husbands. Well I'll home now, and bring the true word next time: I shall expect my wife anon red hot with zeal, and big with melting tears; and this night do I expect, (As her manner is) she will weep me a whole chamberpot full, loquor lapides? do i cast pills abroad?

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
