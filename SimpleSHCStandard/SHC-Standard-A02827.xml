           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <head>To my singular honest stationer, Mr. Robert Mylbourne, at his shop in decimo sexto, by the South door of Paul's. </head>
        <p xml:id="A02827-e100090">As you are a true bookseller, you must approve yourself a ●ue book-restorer: and therefore by book or by crook, see that you send back my book. And yet not my book. For it was but a borrowed book, for which my promise and credit lie in mortgage to the author, the schoolmaster of ha●y, who with some difficulty lent it me, having no other copy of this English lesson w●. he prepared for ●a by-exercise for his scholars at the last Carnival. He told me that he huddled it up in haste, and that it being only an essay of his own faculty, and of the activity of his tenderlings, he was loath it should come under<pb facs="3"/> any other eye, then of those parents and domestic friends who favourably beheld it, when it was represented by the children. And therefore, I must be, and am tender of suffering it to wander I know not whither, by the out let of your friend's hand: whom as I know not, so I cannot challenge of any trust; but require restitution of you, as the author doth of me. So, expecting without delay, the return of this bird into the cage, I end with a threat, that if you fail, you must look to have this comedy turned into a tragedy, and, for detaining this book, to have your name set on the back side of my book. Whereto I add yet a deeper curse, that next time you meet with good fellows in Epping forest, you may not be so happy, as to feed them with nuts in stead of money.</p>

The truth is my friend, upon the sight of this moral, scholastical, theatrical treatise, protested that the author should receive much right in being thus wronged; and upon sufficient bond undertook to save me harmless if I made it more public than ever was intended. And withal he armed me with a legal defence, that, if I restored ten sold for the principal, the author (Notwithstanding his modesty) could frame no just quarrel against me or you at the bar of justice<pb facs="4"/> or reputation. Accordingly he encouraged me (If master schoolmaster of Hadley should school● you for promise-breach) to stop his mouth with a dozen of chicken hatched under his own hen.</p>
        <p xml:id="A02827-e100180">I pray you therefore in stead of his own single written Co●, copy him with this packet of his own mettle stamped and multiplied by the printers alchemy. </p>
        <p xml:id="A02827-e100190">The w●st I hear, is, that he will complain to Apollo of me that I have proclaimed abroad his private shroving.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
