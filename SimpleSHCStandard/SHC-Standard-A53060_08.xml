           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

            </sp>

              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e101170">If well-tempered men be of that opinion, they are fools, which I will soon prove them to be. As first for the commonwealth, there is nothing more disadvantageous; for those commonwealths flourish with greatest glory, that are fullest populated, by reason populated kingdoms are strongest, both for their own defence, and against foreign enemies, as being able to conquer others by invasions, enlarging their dominions with their numbers, increasing their numbers with their numerous issues, begotten and born from their many wives, concubines, and slaves: when by our niggardly laws kingdoms become uninhabited and barren for want of men to till and manure the ground: and as for our wars, they'd seem as private challenges, and our armies as particular duellers, being met with their seconds to decide their petty quarrels, and to show their valour by the hazard of their lives, and our battles seem slight skirmishes, or like a company or rout that kill each other in an idle fray. Thus in comparison of other empires, all Europe is but as one kingdom, for numbers of men, and martial forces, when by the extent it may be accounted the fourth part of the known world. And as for particular families, want of children breeds discontent, and not only destroys industry, but makes spoil and unthrifts; for those that have no children, they care not what becomes of their goods, lands, or livings, spending them through cluelessness, or through riot: and as for women, it spoils them from being good wives; for being sole mistresses, having no copartners, nor shares, neither of their husbands, children, or estates, and being the only she that is served or attended, embraced, loved, or maintained, grows proud, imperious, insults and domineers, and disputes with her husband for preeminency, and the truth is, for the most part, obtains it. Thus men become slaves to the distaff for quietness' sake, otherwise there is such quarrels and brawleries, that his house and home, that should be his couch of ease, his bed of rest, his peaceable haven, or haven of peace, is for the most part his couch of thorns, his bed of cares, his hell of torments, or tormenting hell, and his whole family are like a tempestuous sea, where passions hurl into factions, and rise in waves of discontent: but when men have an absolute power over their wives, they force them into quiet obedience; and where men have many wives, concubines, and slaves, the women are humbled into a submission, each woman striving which should be most serviceable, and who can get most love and favour; and as for bastards, they are as much the father's children, as those that are got in wedlock.</p>

I said I supposed at the usual time, about noon, or an hour before or after, but they said their master never kept any certain time of eating, being full of business. Then I asked them what time that would be when he would come home to bed: they answered, that his time of resting was as uncertain as his time of eating. Then I prayed them to tell me at what time they thought I might find him at home: they said it was impossible for them to guess, for that their master did move from place to place, as swift as thoughts move in the mind. Then I prayed them that they would tell him when he came home, that you would desire to speak with him: they told me they would, but they did verily believe he would forget to come to you, by reason his head was so full of busy thoughts, or thoughts of business, as there was no room more for a thought to stay in. So I went away in despair, but coming home, I chanced to see him at a little distance, so I made all the haste I could to overtake him, placing my eyes fixedly upon him, because I would not lose him; but his pace was so swift, and his several turnings in several lanes and allies were so many, as it was impossible for me to keep my measure, pace, or sight, for like a bird, he did not only fly out of my reach, but out of my view; but by a second good fortune, I met him just at your gate, and I stopped his way until I had told him your message, which was, you would speak with him: he answered me, he could not possibly stay, for his business called him another way. I told him, that if he did not come and speak with you, or stay until you did come and speak with him, his lawsuit, which was of great importance, would be lost, for you could not do him any further service to your friends, that should help him, until he had resolved you of some questions you were to ask him; besides that, you wanted a writing that he had. He told me that he was very much obliged to you for your favour to him, but he could not possibly stay to speak with you, for he had some business to do for two or three other men, and he must of necessity go seek those men out whom the business concerned; so that I could not persuade him by any means, although for his own good, to come in, or to stay till you went to him.</p>

O nature, nature, hadst thou no other way to create a man, unless thou madest a woman! But if thou wert forced by the fates to make that sex, yet thou hadst liberty to make her of a constant mind; but thou art inconstant thyself, as being of female kind: but since I must marry, discretion shall make the choice, which will choose virtue before wealth, wit before beauty, breeding before birth; if she hath virtue, she will be chaste; if she hath wit, she will be conversable, if she hath good breeding, she will be modest and well-behaved. But where is that woman that is virtuously chaste, wittily conversable, and modestly-behaved? If any woman be thus, as I would have her, it is mademoiselle Bon' esprit, she seems to have a noble soul by her honourable actions, which women, for the most part, are so far from, as they seem, for the most part, to have no souls at all, by their mean and petty actions: also she hath a supernatural wit, I mean supernatural, as being a woman; and her wit is not only ingenious, but judicious, by which she will set a value on subjects of merit and worth, and despise those that are base; when fools know not how to prize the best, but choose that is bad, not knowing what is good, so walk in errors ways, which leads unto dishonour; but she, having wit and honour, knows the benefit of honesty so well, as she will be chaste for her own sake, were it not for her husbands. But I most satirically have translated her sweet and harmless mirth, which was presented in her elevated verse into a wanton interpretation. Diana, thou goddess of chastity, pardon me! But stay thoughts, whither wander you? let me examine you before you pass any farther, as whether or no you are not led by the bowstring of Cupid, or the girdle of Venus, into the foul paths of vain desires, and deluding beauty, to the labyrinth of destruction, there to be kept and incaptivated by the entanglements and subtle windings, and turnings, and various passages of amorous love? But a strict examination requires time, and a just<pb facs="151" n="279"/> judge decides not a cause without debate; therefore I will have another contemplation of consideration, before I address my suit, or make known my desires.</p>

              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111450">I can: and first for valour. Have you gone to the wars, and fought? why, millions do the like, and a poor common soldier will venture for sixpence on that which a vain cavalier will hardly do to gain an immortal fame: or peradventure you have fought duels, why every drunkard will do as much, who in their drink they not reason to consider valour, which is only to fight for the sake of honour; but most commonly duels are fought through anger, or fear, or scorn, or revenge, or the like, which is not true valour, but they fight rather like beasts than men, as with force, fury, or appetite, caused by natural antipathies, or through the heat of the blood, or desires or dislikes of the senses: whereas true valour is just, temperate, patient, prudent, and is the heroic part, or virtue of the soul: and to be valiant, is to fight for the right of truth, and the defence of innocency, without partiality, covetousness, or ambition: also to prove yourself valiant, have you received misfortunes with patience, and suffered torments with fortitude? Have you forgiven your enemies, or spared a bloody execution for humanity's sake, or released rich prisoners without ransom, and poor without slavery? Have you heard yourself slandered with patience, justified your wrongs with temperance, fought your enemies without anger, maintained your honour without vainglory, than you are valiant.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111460">And for wisdom, what do you call wisdom? to speak hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and not understand them? or to understand them, and cannot speak them? Or to cite dead authors? Or to repeat their learned opinions? Or to make Sophisterian disputes? Or to speak Latin sentences? Or to tell storeys out of histories? Or to write several hands? Or to spell with true orthography? Or to talk of the sciences, but study none? Or to talk of morality, but practice none? This you may call learned, but not wisdom. But to be wise, have you settled a kingdom in peace, and put it in order, when it was embroiled with civil wars, or ensnared with confused and entangled laws? Or have you appeased a mutinous and half-starved army? Have you led an army with order, pitched a field with art,<pb facs="152" n="280"/> fought a battle with prudence, or have made a safe and honourable retreat? Or have you been so provident, as to relieve famine with fore-stored provisions? Or to prevent misfortunes with foresight? Or have you distinguished a cause clearly, or given an upright judgement? Or have you delivered judicious counsel, and given seasonable and suitable admonitions? Have you composed a commonwealth, or made profitable laws to uphold a commonwealth? Have you defended a commonwealth from enemies, or purged a commonwealth from factions? Have you made officers worthy of employments, magistrates able to govern, soldiers skilful to command? Have you fitly matched men and business, and offices with men? Have you employed the idle, and given light to the ignorant? Have you discharged a commonwealth of superfluity, or superfluous commodities, and brought in those which are more useful, such as they have wanted? Have you manured a barren country, or enriched a poor kingdom? Have you made honest associates, faithful agreements, and safe traffics? Then you may think yourself wise, and be silent; for the actions will proclaim it.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111470">Also what do you call wit? Imitating extravagancies like a jackanapes, or a buffoon, to extort the countenance with making wry faces? Or with much laughter to show the teeth, which perchance are all rotten in the head? Or foolishly to divulge the infirmities of particular persons in an open assembly? Or putting innocency or youth out of countenance? Or to disturb the serious with idle sports? Or disorder the wise with foolish and rude jests? Or do you all wit affected dresses, affected garbs, affected countenances, or vain-strained compliments, or useless words, or senseless speeches, or cross answers, or impertinent questions? But for your wit, hath your fame flown beyond Euripides, Homer, or Ovid, your descriptions beyond Horace, or your verse beyond Virgil? Have you oratory to equal the orators of Athens, Lacedæmonians, or Rome? or have you devised any ingenious inventions, or produced any profitable arts, or found out any new sciences? Then you are witty.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111480">Likewise what do you call honesty? to live luxuriously to yourself, not meddling, nor intermingling yourself and home-affairs with the public affairs of the world? To keep open house at Christmas? To give your scraps to the poor? To pay wages duly, debts justly, taxes quietly? To kiss your maids privately? And although all this is good and commendable, but the kissing of your maids, yet it is not enough to make a perfect honest man: but to be perfectly honest, have you tempered your insatiable appetite with abstinency, moderated your violated passions with reason, governed your unruly actions with prudence? Have you not exacted unjustly, judged partially, accused falsely, betrayed treacherously, kept wrongfully, took forcibly? but have you advanced virtues, defended the innocent? Have you witnessed for truth, pleaded for right, and stood for the defenceless? Then you are perfectly honest.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111490">Also what do you call generosity? To give a present to a lewd mistress? To bribe a corrupted judge? Or fee a subtle lawyer? Or feast the vain courtiers? Or maintain sycophants and flatterers? Or bail a just arrest? Or to be bound for the deboist? Or to give ladies collations? Or to lend or give idle drunken fellows money? Or to give when you think to hear of it again? This is prodigality, not generosity. But to be generous, have you set your prisoner free, ransomed the captives, or bought off the chains<pb facs="152" n="281"/> of the galley-slaves? Have you maintained young orphans, or helped poor widows? Have you cheered the aged, nourished the hungry, succoured the infirm, relieved the distressed, comforted the sorrowful, and guided the ignorant? Or have you upholden an ancient family from sinking? Then you are generous.</p>
              <p xml:id="A53060_08-e111500">As for your person, the more handsome and beautiful you are, the more effeminate you seem. But to conclude, that man that hath a narrow heart, and a mean soul, that only seeks his own delights, which all vainglorious persons do, I will not marry: for noble ambition hath a heart, whose veins with bounty flow, and wears her life only for honour's use and virtues need.</p>

Infirmities proceed directly from nature, Loss from possession, misfortunes from interpositions, baseness from that creature called man, and wickedness from devils: the first is caused by the carelessness of nature, the second by the lack of power, the third by the necessity of fate, the fourth by the corruption of man, the last by the persuasion and temptation of the devil. The first, second, and third are not to be avoided, the fourth not to be practised, the fifth not to be followed nor fostered. The first is to be pitied, the second to be grieved for, the third to be lamented for, the fourth to be scorned, and the fifth to be hated and abhorred. Thus we may grieve for the loss of her beauty, but not pity her, having no natural defect in the soul, which is the understanding, and the rational part.</p>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
