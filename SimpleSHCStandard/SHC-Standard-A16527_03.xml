           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <head>The argument.</head>
        <p xml:id="A16527_03-e100090">When Alexander the great, after all his conquests (Shining through the glory of innumerable victories) was returned back to Babylon, where the ambassadors of the whole world did attend his coming, as one that was destinied to domineer over all: there being admired by the Grecians, adored by the barbarians, and as it were drunken with the delights of an extraordinary prosperity, he suffered himself to be transported with an inundation of pleasure; till sitting at one of his feasts by the means of the sons of Antipater his cupbearers, in the best, both of his age and fortune, he was suddenly poisoned.</p>
        <p xml:id="A16527_03-e100100">Incontinent after his death, those that were in great estimation with himself during his life, and then with the army, assembled themselves together, neglecting for a long time his funerals, whilst busied about the disposing of his empire: at last (After divers opinions) it was concluded, that if Roxane, the widow of their deceased sovereign (Who was then at the point to be delivered of her birth) happened to bear a son, he should succeed in his father's place, and till he were come to some maturity of age, Perdiccas, Leonatus, Craterus, and Antipater were appointed to be his tutors: but the footmen in a disdain, that their advice was not required, proclaimed Arideus, Alexander's bastard brother<pb facs="91"/> King, and gave him a guard, of which Meleager procured himself to be made captain. At this sudden alteration, the horsemen being troubled, they following Perdiccas pitched their camp without the city; yet in the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of Perdiccas appeased, all the captains reassembled themselves, and having divided the provinces, made an agreement, which lasted not long: for such was the vehement ambition of those great men, that with all manner of hostility, they studied how to undermine one another, and first of all, Meleager after a pretended reconciliation, (Though having fled to a temple for refuge) was slain by the appointment of Perdiccas, who after aspiring to a superiority over the rest, whilst he went to war against Ptolemy in Egypt, by a sudden mutiny of his own soldiers was miserably murdered. Then the only captain of his faction that remained alive, was Eumenes, a man singularly valorous, who encountering with Craterus and Neoptolemus, by the death of themselves defeated their army, whereby being highly advanced, he was greatly envied ▪ and (Leonatus having lately before died in a conflict betwixt him and the Athenians,) Antigonus in the name of the rest was sent against him with a great army, betwixt whom there having passed divers skirmishes with a variable success, and some private conference without agreement: in the end, he was betrayed by his own soldiers, and delivered bound to Antigonus, who shortly after caused him to be put to death.</p>
        <p xml:id="A16527_03-e100110">Then Antigonus (His rivals in the authority being removed out of his way) did aspire to that himself, from which he was sent to seclude others, and having murdered divers of the governors, he disposed of their provinces as he pleased: whereof Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lisimachus, advertised by Seleucus, who fled for fear of incurring the like danger; they entered all together in a league against Antigonus. </p>
        <p xml:id="A16527_03-e100120">Now at this time Olimpias plagued all the faction of Cassander<pb facs="91"/> in Macedon, having caused Arideus and his Queen Eurydice to be put to death; by which, and other cruelties (Having lost the favour of the people) she was constrained, when Cassander came against her, to retire herself within a town; which (By reason of the scarcity of victuals) not being able to defend, she rendered, together with herself to Cassander, by whom (Notwithstanding of his promise to the contrary) she was publicly put to death, and so having proceeded so far in wickedness, he thought it no time to retire till he had extinguished all his master's race; he caused Roxane and her son to be murdered; and soon after, Hercules, Alexander's bastard son, which multitude of murders, gave to him the crown of Macedon; and to me, the subject of this politragic tragedy.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
