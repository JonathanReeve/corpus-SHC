           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Before I went to the wars, I came to the town a young fellow without means, or parts, to deserve friends; and my empty guts persuaded me to lie, and abuse people for my meat, which I did, and they beat me: then would I fast two days, till my hunger cried out on me, rail still; then methought I had a monstrous stomach to abuse them again, and did it. In this state I continued till they hung me up by th'heels and beat me with hazel sticks, as if they would have baked me, and have cozened somebody with me for venison: after this I railed, and sat quietly: for the whole kingdom took notice of me for a baffled whipt fellow, and what I said, was remembered in mirth, but never in anger; of which I was glad,<pb facs="23" n="42"/> I would it were at that pass again: after this, God called an aunt of mine, that left two hundred pounds in a cousin's hand for me, who taking me to be a gallant young spirit, raised a company for me with the money, and sent me into Armenia with 'em: away I would have run from them, but that I could get no company, and alone I durst not run. I was never at battle but once, and there I was running, but Mardonius cudgeled me; yet I got loose at last, but was so afraid, that I saw no more than my shoulders do, but fled with my whole company amongst my enemies, and overthrew 'em: now the report of my valour is come over before me, and they say I was a raw young fellow, but now I am improved. A plague of their eloquence, 'twill cost me many a beating: and Mardonius might help this too if he would; for now they think to get honour of me, and all the men I have abused, call me freshly to account, worthily as they call it, by the way of challenge.</p>

The place where it must be ended, is four days' journey of, and our arbitrators are there: he has chosen a gentleman in travel, and I have a special friend, with a quartern ague likely to hold him this time here, for mine; and when his man comes home, we are to expect my friend's health: if they would send me challenges thus thick, as long as I lived I would have no other living; I can make seven shillings a day oh th' paper to the grocers: yet I learn nothing by all these but a little skill in comparing of styles. I do find evidently that there is some one scrivener in this town, that has a great hand in writing of challenges, for they are all of a cut, and six of 'em in a hand; and they all end, my reputation is dear to me, and I must require satisfaction: who's there? more paper I hope; no, 'tis my lord Bacurius, I fear all is not well betwixt us.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
