           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Pardon the rudeness of my public address to you, in the number of many whom which more excuse, I might have interrupted. I am bold, but your mercy will incline you not to despise these (At the worst) but errors of my devotion, and the weak expression of his service, whose desires are to be known,</p>

This is not hell, sure I feel no torment, and there is too little company, no 'tis not hell — and I ha' not lived after the rate of going to heaven; yet beside, I met just now a usurer, that only deals upon ounces, and carries his scales at his girdle, with which he uses to weigh, not men's necessities, but the plate he is to lend money upon, can this fellow come to heaven? Here a poor fellow is put i'th stocks for being drunk, and the constable himself reeling home, charges others i'th King's name to aid him. There's a spruce captain, newly crept out of a gentleman usher, and shuffled into a buff jerkin with gold lace, that never saw service beyond Finsbury or the artillery garden, marches waving a desperate feather in his lady's beaver, while a poor soldier, bred up in the school of war all his life, yet never commenced any degree of commander, wants a piece of brass, to discharge a wheaten bullet to his? belly no — this is not heaven I know by the people that traffic in't, where am I then? Umh I'll to worthies before they bury me, and inform myself better what's become a me, if I find not myself there in a coffin, there's hope I may revive again, if I be dead, I am in a world very like the other, I will get me a female spirit to converse withal and kiss, and be merry, and imagine myself alive again. <stage xml:id="A12157-e123860">Exit.</stage></p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
