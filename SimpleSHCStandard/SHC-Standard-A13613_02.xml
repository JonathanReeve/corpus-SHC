Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

          <head>The argument.</head>
          <p xml:id="A13613_02-e100050">A citizen of Athens dwelling at Sunium a port-town of Attica having two children, Chremes a son, and Pamphila a daughter, had his daughter stolen away by pirates when she was of such tender age that she could only tell her own and parents names. After this the Athenian died. The pirates sold the child to a merchant of Rhodes, who gave her to a strumpet which he loved. This harlot had a daughter called Thais, somewhat elder than Pamphila: which children she so brought up together, that all men of Rhodes did repute them for sisters. Thais in process of time took to her mother's trade of life; and yielding up herself to a stranger's devotion, was by him carried to Athens; where he dying left her good means. He thus dead, she was taken up by one Thraso a soldier: he also having a while accompanied her, had occasion of travail into Caria. Meanwhile <pb facs="36" n="51"/> the mother of Thais died at Rhodes: her goods fell to a brother, who (With them) exposed to sale the abovenamed Pamphila, just upon the time wherein the soldier passed that way. Her youth and beauty induced the soldier (Ignorant of all passages) to buy her, as a fit gift to bestow on Thais at his return to Athens. But she before that time (Whores do not live in expectation, nor upon the means of one man only) had entertained the love of one Phaedria a young gentleman, son of an ancient Athenian citizen. She also had by this time gained some inkling of the parentage of Pamphila, and that one Chremes a gentleman of Athens was in good likelihood natural brother to the maiden: for better discovery whereof, she had had conference with him (A loof off) touching the matter. The soldier returns to Athens bringing Pamphila along with him, (Her maidenhead is questioned by Terence, act. 1. Scen. 2. in these words etiamne amplius? To avoid matter unfitting for the grace of the comedy, but she was (Beyond any contrary supposable conjecture) a maiden: for a child might villip this soldier out of his courage; and foolery was all the allurement he could use to her) and being thus returned, he finds Phaedria entered into Thais her books: out of which if he be not clean wiped, Pamphila is not for her, as the soldier affirmeth. Terence hath set out this Thais as none of the<pb facs="37" n="52"/> worst of that course of life; and withal of good discretion in her carriage. A dilemma is now put upon her; love and consideration are the two horns: she must venture the goring by one of them. Love pleads first, and this is natural to her blood; and Phaedria besides deserves it. I but he may be tendered a wife; his appetite cloyed his father work her displeasure. Resolute love in spite of these premises hath down the conclusion on the other side a reputed sister, that sister hath good friends, those friends able to strengthen her unsettled fortunes; if by her means the one be restored to the other: thus pleads consideration. Wisely therefore she keeps the middle way for barring Phaedria her company for a brace of days (Telling him why) she aims to gull the soldier of the wench by this courtesy; and then to recall Phaedria to his former contentment. Phaedria assents, leaves the city. gives withal charge to Parmeno his father's man, for bringing an eunuch to Thais in his absence: Phaedria gone, Thraso also sends Pamphila to her by Gnato a parasite. In the passing of the maiden thither, Chaerea a younger brother of Phaedria spies her, falls in love with her, dogs her, by accident loseth her, chafes with himself at it: then to Parmeno coming upon him, discovers his mind and whereto carried. Parmeno informs him of an eunuch by his brother Phaedria sent, and by him forthwith to be conveyed<pb facs="37" n="53"/> to the very house where the maid abideth. So that by shifting clothes with the eunuch he may undiscovered be brought to her; the eunuch nor he having ever before been seen by Thais or any of her family Chaerea follows the advice, is brought thither, ravisheth the maiden. Much coil hence ariseth, Pamphila at length being found to be freeborn, Chaerea marries her; Thais is taken into protection by the father of the two brothers. The soldier for mirth and cost sparing is admitted among them, by Gnato's persuasion, with the consent of Phaedria. </p>

Another of the old man's sons, an early cock of the game: the heat of his youthful blood violently caries him on to a rape: either he was passed an Ephebus, or grammarians mistaken in the word, or else Terence hath been very bold in the part of Chaerea lustful, heady, headstrong.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
