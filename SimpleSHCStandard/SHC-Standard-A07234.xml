           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Many years he happily spent in the service of your honourable house, and died a servant to it; leaving his, to be ever most glad, and ready, to be at the command of all such, as derive themselves from his most honoured master, your lordship's most noble father. The consideration of this, encouraged me (Having no other means to present my humblest service to your honour) to shroud this trifle, under the<pb facs="3"/><pb facs="3"/><pb facs="4"/> wings of your noble protection; and I hope out of the clemency of your heroic disposition, it will find, though perhaps not a welcome entertainment, yet at the worst a gracious pardon. When it was first acted, your lordship's liberal suffrage taught others to allow it for currant, it having received the undoubted stamp of your lordship's allowance: and if in the perusal of any vacant hour, when your honour's more serious occasions shall give you leave to read it, it answer in your lordship's judgement, the report and opinion it had upon the stage, I shall esteem my labours not ill employed, and while I live continue,</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
