           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

My ambition herein aims at a fair flight, born up on the double wings of gratitude, for a received, and acknowledgement for a continued love. It is not so frequent to number many kinsmen, and amongst them some friends; as to presume on some friends, and amongst them little friendship. But in every fullness of these particulars, I do not more partake through you (My cousin) the delight, then enjoy the benefit of them. This inscription to your name, is only a faithful deliverance to memory of the truth of my respects to virtue, and to the equal<pb facs="3"/> in honour with virtue, desert. The contempt thrown on studies of this kind, by such as dote on their own singularity, hath almost so outfaced invention, and prescribed judgement; that it is more safe, more wise, to be suspectedly silent, then modestly confident of opinion, herein. Let me be bold to tell the severity of censurers, how willingly I neglect their practice, so long as I digress from no becoming thankfulness. Accept then (My cousin) this witness to posterity of my constancy to your merits, for no ties of blood, no engagements of friendship shall more justly live a precedent, than the sincerity of both in the heart of</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
