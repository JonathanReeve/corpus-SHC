           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

For the gentleman that wrote it, his poem itself can better speak his praise, than any oratory from me. Nor can I tell whether this work was divulged with his consent or no: but howsoever, since it hath passed the test of the stage with so general an applause, pity it were but it should likewise have the honour of the press. As for master green, all that I will speak of him (And that without flattery) is this (If I were worthy to censure) there was not an actor of his nature in his time of better ability in performance of what he undertook; more applaudent by the audience, of greater grace at the court, or of more general love in the city, and so with this brief character of his memory, I commit him to his rest.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
