           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Methinks I should not follow that instruction now; if having the<pb facs="24"/> means to do an honest office for an honest fellow, I should neglect it. Charlemont lies in prison for a thousand crowns. And here I have a thousand crowns. Honesty tells me 'twere well done to release Charlemont. But discretion says I had much ado to come by this; and when this shall be gone I know not where to singer any more: especially if I employ it to this use, which is like to endanger me into my father's perpetual displeasure. And then I may go hang myself, or be forced to do that, will make another save me the labour. No matter. Charlemont! Thou gavest me my life and that's somewhat of a purer earth than gold as fine as it is. 'tis no courtesy I do thee but thankfulness. I owe thee it and I'll pay it. He sought bravely, but the officers dragged him villanously. Arrant knaves! for using him so discourteously; may the sins o'the poor people be so few, that you sha'not be able to spare so much out o'your gettings, as will pay for the hire of a lame starved hackney to ride to an execution. But go a foot to the gallows, and be hanged. May elder brothers turn good husbands, and younger brothers get good wives; that there be no need of debt-books, nor use of sergeants. May there be all peace but i'the war, and all charity but i'the devil; so that prisons may be turned to hospitals, though the officers live oath benevolence. If this curse might come to pass, the world would say, blessed be he that curseth. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
