           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Nature is the mistress of his faculties and no custom, which are rude and stubborn and will admit not laws but what themselves enact, nor strictly observe them neither.

Kings are petty gods and may tempt us, nor is it want or desire of innovation that thus stirreth us, we are in the best ill state already, nor ambition to strike at that laurel which the thunder spares, no we reverence it, and know that as men are the works of nature, so Kings of Jove. But 'tis our oath the sacrament we took, which still holds us though our lord be dead, until his successor do quit us from it, by taking of a new one, we are not subjects, but slaves to him we now obey, and therefore as slaves we ought to hate our master; he was born less than we, and hides the private man under the public gown; the purple which he wears was dipped deep in the blood of innocents to colour't so. But I vainly waste myself in words, here are no minds to be persuaded, nor ears to be instructed; the sins we are to punish, we all know, and the gods remember, our strength then is all we are to speak of, which is the greatest half of the isle 16. years undisturbed provision, so carelessly was that provided for which was got by blood, there is but one lordship, small in respect of others, the tyrants own possession that will stand strong for him, but they are so besotted with their fortunes that their greatest aid will be but in their will to do him service. They may offer up their lives, like so many sacrifices for his sake, but not like soldiers, they are unworthy of that name: they may die but never conquer, war is never talked of but in their banquets, nor dare they fight beyond a brawl.</p>

Then they clothed me in a body, foul as the tragedy I was to act, and made me dote on those deformities which all did loathe, when they had bewitched me with these false, yet glittering names, and I obeyed their black commands, in a moment they changed into repentance, a mournful figure: and sadly left me as they first did find<pb facs="44"/> me, and as I now appear to you.</p>

But had I beheld you before their danger, it would have turned my soul within me, changed me from a foe unto their party. I cannot now believe I had a justice, that there could be anywhere you were injured in it, so much my love doth mount above my grief, that it makes me think I have only lost your father. Why weep you thus? Could that recall him, I'd bear you company, and break those stubborn gates, which from my childhood to this present hour hath kept them back, and spend my whole store here. But nothing can redeem him, let that common remedy which all apply, and helpeth all, give ease unto you, that nothing can redeem him.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
