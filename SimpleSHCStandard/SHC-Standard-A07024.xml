           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

How such an excellent, and divine part of humanity should fall under the least contempt, or arm the petulancy of writers to declaim against her, I know not: but I guess the reason, that having their souls darkened, and rejoicing in their errors, are offended at the lustre of those arts that would enlighten them. But the fates have not so ill befriended our studies, as to expose them to contempt, without the protection of such, whose ability of judgement can both wipe off all aspersions, and dignify desert. Amongst the worthy patrons of learning, that can best vindicate her worth, you are not the least; and because custom and respect to noble friends, gives a privilege to dedicate our endeavours where they may find admittance, I have made bold to present this piece unto you. It hath often pleased, and without intermission. If you shall second that applause by your kind favour, it shall not aspire to be more honoured.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
