           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A18423-e100380">Right noble and worthy assembly: it hath been a very ancient and laudable custom, in the best governed common-wealthes, to admit and favourably to allow interludes and discourses upon the stage for divers reasons; but especially two. The one, to entertain the welconditioned people with some delightful and fruitful conceits, thereby as it were to deceive idleness of that time which it had allotted for worse purposes. The other, for the just reprehension of such as with serious and more grave advisings cannot or will not be so freely admonished and corrected. The later of these two respects hath begotten this dialogue, ready to be acted, principally and specially pointing that imp which is infortunately fostered up to this day, to ruin itself with infamy. Only this comfort is afforded, that if he be present, and withal silent, he may suppose that of all others it concerns not him. If he be absent (As most likely he is) than every other that finds himself parcel guilt may see the deformity, and forbear the excess. Other touches and passages are, which our author and we present not with mind to offend any, but to please the weldisposed. And so in the name of all the rest I entreat courteous audience, and pardon of all faults.</p>

There we walk as if the whole world hath need to be informed, yea and directed by us in matters of greatest moment; such as is traffic and commerce with foreign nations, and the state and disposition of those kingdoms through which we have passed. For it may be we can give intelligence of preparations and invasions. We can demonstrate their strength and munition. We can number their captains and generals. We can discover their designs and confederates. And finally, we can lay plots to cross and make void all their purposes, and stratagems, which these homebred and country spun people can never attain unto. Therefore by good right we are had in esteem, and special request, and courteously received of councillors of state wheresoever we come. Neither do we tie ourselves to any one dominion more than another, but indifferently to all states we deliver freely the condition of every nation. And the place we ●●ll i●●o is our best beloved so long as there we tarry, and<pb facs="4"/> not a minute longer. We oblige ourselves to no prince for gold nor gain, nor be pensioners to any monarch: but with desire to see more we pass through all governments, unchecked and uncontrolled, because we take part with none, offend, none, nor are false to any. And this life we love above all lives, not content with any life, but that which seeks another life.</p>

For which purpose it is said, such work as thou dost, work it in those six days, and not on the seventh day. Yet God did never forbid any of those six days to be kept holy ▪ and the christian church hath appointed many days to be kept holy in memory of saints which suffered divers torments for Christ's sake, who suffered all for them, and for them all. And those to be kept to the world's end, that their facts and fame might never die, but encourage others to tread their bloody but heavenly steps. <pb facs="17"/>Therefore since the church of God and custom of Christian countries have so ordered it, let no man's private rashness presume such alteration, as to make away or put out the holidays, but with due reverence to observe them.</p>

What time and order your hounds observe with their natural harmony, I will not dispute (They and their keepers being seldom in order) but of this I am sure, that there are few kennels of hounds in England ▪ but while some are in chase after hare, or fox, others are killing sheep in full cry of the poor harmless beast: whereupon is grown that proverb. The fox kills the lambs ▪ and the hounds the old sheep. But I cannot endure you should challenge hunting to 〈◊〉 better with a gentleman then hawking. Every clown can keep a dog, and the more carrion he eateth the more egregiously he smelleth: but the hawk adorneth a King's fist, besides the admirable conquest the falconer maketh in a hawk's nature, bringing the wild haggard having all the earth and seas to scour over uncontrollable, to attend and obey her keeper so, that at his very voice she<pb facs="20"/> turns towards and stoops to his glove. Hounds are so prejudicial to the commonwealth, that I dare undertake to prove, that (Next unto drunkards) they are the greatest spoilers of poor men's bread.</p>

And this was Mr. <hi ana="387" n="STRIPTAG">Rellips'</hi> linen. The other was that you marked pillows, and other stuff of a noble man's with your own mark, and used them as your own.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
