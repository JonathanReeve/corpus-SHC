           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

Hence is it, that I now render myself grateful, and am studious to justify the bounty of your act: to which, though your mere authority were satisfying, yet, it being an age, wherein poetry, and the professors of it hear so ill, on all sides, there will a reason be looked for in the subject. It is certain, nor can it with any forehead be opposed, that the too-much licence of poetasters, in this time, hath much deformed their mistress; that, every day, their manifold, and manifest ignorance, doth stick unnatural reproaches upon her: but for their petulancy, it were an act of the greatest injustice, either to let the learned suffer; or so divine a skill (Which indeed should not be attempted with unclean hands) to fall, under the least contempt. For, if men will impartially, and not asquint, look towards the offices, and function of a poet, they will easily conclude to themselves, the impossibility of any man's being the good poet, without first being a good man. He that<pb facs="240" n="443"/> is said to be able to inform young men to all good disciplines, inflame grown men to all great virtues, keepe old-men in their best and supreme state, or as they decline to childhood, recover them to their first strength; that comes forth the interpreter, and arbiter of nature, a teacher of things divine, no less than humane, a master in manners; and can alone (Or with a few) effect the business of mankind: this, I take him, is no subject for pride, and ignorance to exercise their railing rhetoric upon. But, it will here be hastily answered, that the writers of these days are other things; that, not only their manners, but their natures are inverted; and nothing remaining with them of the dignity of poet, but the abused name, which every scribe usurps: that now, especially in dramatic, or (As they term it) stage-poetry, nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blasphemy, all licence of offence to god, and man, is practised. I dare not deny a great part of this (And am sorry, I dare not) because in some men's abortive features (And would they had never boasted the light) it is over-true: but, that all are embarked in this bold adventure for hell, is a most uncharitable thought, and, uttered, a more malicious slander. For my particular, I can (And from a most clear conscience) affirm, that I have ever trembled to think towards the least profaneness; have loathed the use of such foul, and unwashed bawdry, as is now made the food of the scene: and, howsoever I cannot escape, from some, the imputation of sharpness, but that they will say, I have taken a pride,<pb facs="241" n="444"/> or lust, to be bitter, and not my youngest infant but hath come into the world with all his teeth; I would ask of these supercilious politics, what nation, society, or general order, or state I have provoked? what public person? whether I have not (In all these) preserved their dignity, as mine own person, safe? My works are read, allowed, (I speak of those that are entirely mine) look into them: what broad reproofs have I used? Where have I been particular? Where personal? except to a mimic, cheater, bawd, or buffoon, creatures (For their insolences) worthy to be taxed? Yet, to which of these so pointingly, as he might not, either ingenuously have confessed, or wisely dissembled his disease? But it is not rumour can make men guilty, much less entitle me, to other men's crimes. I know, that nothing can be so innocently writ, or carried, but may be made obnoxious to construction; marry, whilst I bear mine innocence about me, I fear it not. Application, is now, grown a trade with many; and there are, that profess to have a key for the deciphering of every thing: but let wise and noble persons take heed how they be too credulous, or give leave to these invading interpreters, to be over-familiar with their fames, who cunningly, and often, utter their own virulent malice, under other men's simplest meanings. As for those, that will (By faults which charity hath raked up, or common honesty concealed) make themselves a name with the multitude, or (To draw their rude, and beastly claps) care not whose living faces they entrench, with their petulant styles;<pb facs="241" n="445"/> may they do it, without a rival, for me: I choose rather to live graved in obscurity, then share with them, in so preposterous a fame. Nor can I blame the wishes of those severe, and wiser patriots, who providing the hurts these licentious spirits may do in a state, desire rather to see fools, and devils, and those antique relics of barbarism retrieved, with all other ridiculous, and exploded follies: then behold the wounds of private men, of princes, and nations. For, as Horace makes Trebatius speak, among these<quote xml:id="A04632_06-e100130"><l xml:id="A04632_06-e100140">— Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intactus, et odit. </l></quote>and men may justly impute such rages, if continued, to the writer, as his sports. The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the present trade of the stage, in all their miscellaneous interludes, what learned or liberal soul doth not already abhor? where nothing but the filth of the time is uttered, and that with such impropriety of phrase, such plenty of soloecismes, such dearth of sense, so bold prolepse's, so racked metaphors, with brothelry, able to violate the ear of a pagan, and blasphemy, to turn the blood of a christian to water. I cannot but be serious in a cause of this nature, wherein my fame, and the reputations of divers honest, and learned are the question; when a name, so full of authority, antiquity, and all great mark, is (Through their insolence) become the lowest scorn of the age: and those men subject to the petulancy of every vernaculous orator, that were wont to be the care of Kings, and happiest monarchs. This it is, that hath not only rapt me to present<pb facs="242" n="444"/><pb facs="242" n="445"/><pb facs="243" n="446"/> indignation, but made me studious, heretofore; and, by all my actions, to stand off, from them: which may most appear in this my latest work (Which you, most learned arbitresses, have seen, judged, and to my crown, approved) wherein I have laboured, for their instruction, and amendment, to reduce, not only the ancient forms, but manners of the scene, the easiness, the propriety, the innocence, and last the doctrine, which is the principal end of poesy, to inform men, in the best reason of living. And though my catastrophe may, in the strict rigour of comic law, meet with censure, as turning back to my promise; I desire the learned, and charitable critic to have so much faith in me, to think it was done off industry: for, with what ease I could have varied it, nearer his scale (But that I fear to boast my own faculty) I could here insert. But my special aim being to put the snaffle in their mouths, that cry out, we never punish vice in our interludes, etc. I took the more liberty; though not without some lines of example, drawn even in the ancients themselves, the goings out of whose comedies are not always joyful, but oft-times, the bawds, the servants, the rivals yea, and the masters are mulcted: and fitly, it being the office of a comic-poet, to imitate justice, and instruct to life, as well as purity of language, or stir up gentle affections. To which, I shall take the occasion elsewhere to speak. For the present (Most reverenced sisters) as I have cared to be thankful for your affections past, and here made the understanding acquainted with some<pb facs="243" n="447"/> ground of your favours; let me not despair their continuance, to the maturing of some worthier fruits: wherein, if my muses be true to me, I shall raise the despised head of poetry again, and stripping her out of those rotten and base rags, wherewith the times have adulterated her form, restore her to her primitive habit, feature, and majesty, and render her worthy to be embraced, and kissed, of all the great and master-spirits of our world. As for the vile, and slothful, who never affected an act, worthy of celebration, or are so inward with their own vicious natures, as they worthily fear her; and think it a high point of policy, to keep her in contempt with their declamatory, and windy invectives: she shall out of just rage incite her servants (Who are genus iritabile) to spout ink in their faces, that shall eat, farther than their marrow, into their fames; and not Cinnamus the barber, with his art, shall be able to take out the brands, but they shall live, and be read, till the wretches die, as things worst deserving of themselves in chief, and then of all mankind.</p>

Gentlemen, if I had but time to discourse to you the miraculous effects of this my oil, surnamed oglio del Scoto; with the countless catalogue of those I have cured of th'aforesaid, and many more diseases; the patents and privileges of all the princes, and commonwealths of Christendom; or but the depositions of those that appeared on my part, before the signiory of the Sanitâ, and most learned college of physicians; where I was authorised, upon notice taken of the admirable virtues of my medicaments, and mine own excellency, in matter of rare, and unknown secrets, not only to disperse them publicly in this famous city, but in all the territories, that happily joy under the<pb facs="256" n="468"/><pb facs="256" n="469"/><pb facs="257" n="470"/> government of the most pious and magnificent states of Italy. But may some other gallant fellow say, oh, there be divers, that make profession to have as good, and as experimented receipts, as yours: indeed, very many have assayed, like apes in imitation of that, which is really and essentially in me, to make of this oil; bestowed great cost in furnaces, stills, alembeks, continual fires, and preparation of the ingredients, (As indeed there goes to it six hundred several simples, besides, some quantity of humane fat, for the conglutination, which we buy of the anatomists) but, when these practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff, puff, and all flies in fumo: ha, ha, ha. Poor wretches! I rather pity their folly, and indiscretion, than their loss of time, and money; for those may be recovered by industry: but to be a fool born, is a disease incurable. For myself, I always from my youth have endeavoured to get the rarest secrets, and book them; either in exchange, or for money: I spared nor cost, nor labour, where any thing was worthy to be learned. And gentlemen, honourable gentlemen, I will undertake (By virtue of chemical art) out of the honourable hat, that covers your head, to extract the four elements; that is to say, the fire, air, water, and earth, and return you your felt without burn, or stain. For, whilst others have been at the balloo, I have been at my book: and am now past the craggy paths of study, and come to the flowery plains of honour, and reputation. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
