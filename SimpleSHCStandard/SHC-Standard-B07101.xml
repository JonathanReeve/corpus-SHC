           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

          <p xml:id="B07101-e100170">At Ely and hatton-houses, the gentlemen and their assistants met, and in this manner prepared for the court. The antimasquers were ushered by a hornpipe, and a shawm, riding in coats and caps of yellow taffeta, spotted with silver, their feathers red, their horses led by men in coats of blue taffeta, their wings red, and part of their sleeves yellow, caps and feathers: all the torch-bearers in the same habit appointed to attend, and give plentiful light to the whole train.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100180">Fancy, in a suit of several coloured feathers hooded. A pair of bats-wings on his shoulders, riding alone as sole presenter of the antimasques.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100190">After him road opinion and confidence together, opinion in an old fashioned doublet of black velvet, and trunk hose, a short cloak of the same with an antique cape, a black velvet cap pinched up, with a white fall, a staff in his hand.</p>
          <pb facs="4" n="2"/>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100200">Confidence in a slashed doublet particoloured breeches suitable with points at knees, favours upon his breast, and arm: a broad brimmed hat, tied upon one side, banded with a feather, a long lock of hair, trimmed with several coloured ribbons, wide boots, and great spurs with bells for rowels.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100210">Next road jollity and laughter. Jollity in a flame-coloured suit, but tricked like a morris-dancer, with scarves and napkins, his hat fashioned like a cone, with a little fall.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100220">Laughter in a long side coat of several colours, laughing vizards on his breast and back, a cap with two grinning faces, and feathers between.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100230">Then followed variety of antic music after which road six projectors, one after another, their horses led by torch-bearers.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100240">The first a jockey with a bonnet on his head upon the top of it a whip, he seeming much to observe and affect a bridle which he had in his hand.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100250">The second a country fellow in a leather doubled and grey trunk hose, a wheel with a perpetual motion on his head, and in his hand a flail.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100260">The third, a grim philosopicall faced fellow in his gown furred, and girdled about him, a furnace upon his head, and in his hand a lamp.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100270">The fourth in a case of black leather vast to the middle, and round on the top, with glass eyes, and bellows under each arm.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100280">The fist a physician, on his head a hat with a bunch of carrots, a capon perched upon his fist.</p>
          <pb facs="4" n="3"/>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100290">The sixth like a seaman, a ship upon his head and holding a line and plummet in his hand.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100300">Here variety of other antic music counterfeiting the voices of birds, and after these road, a magpie, a crow, a jay, and a kite, in a quadrangular figure, and in the midst an owl, these were followed by three satires, two a breast, and one single, sided with torch-bearers. Then three dotterels in the same manner and attendance.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100310">After these a windmill, against which a fantastic knight with his lance, and his squire armed seemed to make their attempts.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100320">These moving forward in ridiculous show and postures, a drummer followeth on horseback, in a crimson taffeta coat, a white hat and feather, tipped with crimson, beating two kettle drums.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100330">Then 14. Trumpeters, in crimson satin coats, white hats and feathers, and rich banners.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100340">The marshal followed these bravely mounted. attended with forty foot, in coats and hose of scarlet trimmed with silver-lace, white hats and feathers, their truncheons tipped with silver: these upon every occasion moving to and fro, to preserve the order of their march, and restrain the rudeness of people, that in such triumphs, are wont to be insolent, and tumultuary.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100350">After these an hundred gentlemen, gloriously furnished and gallantly mounted, riding two and two a breast, every gentleman having his two pages richly attired, and a groom to attend him.</p>
          <pb facs="5" n="4"/>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100360">Next after these a chariot drawn by four horses, two and two together, richly furnished and adorned with gold and silver, the charioteer in a Polonian coat of green cloth of silver. In this were advanced musicians like priests and Sibyls, sons and daughters of harmony, some with coronets, other with wreathes of laurel and myrtle, playing upon their lutes, three footmen on each side in blue satin wrought with silver, and every one a flambeaux in his hand.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100370">In the next chariot of equal glory, were placed on the lowest stairs four in sky-coloured taffeta robes seeded with stars, mantles ash coloured, adorned with fringe, and silver-lace, coronets with stars upon their heads. In a seat a little more elevate sat Geniu, and amphiluchs. </p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100380">On the highest seat of this chariot, sat the three hours, or heavenly sisters, Irene, Diche, and Eunomia. All whose habits shall be described in their proper places: this chariot attended as the former.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100390">After these came the four triumphals or magnificent chariots, in which were mounted the grand masquers, one of the four houses in every chariot, seated within an half oval, with a glorious canopy over their heads, all bordered with silver fringe, and beautified with plumes of feathers on the top.</p>
          <list xml:id="B07101-e100400">
            <item xml:id="B07101-e100410">The first chariot, silver and Orange.</item>
            <item xml:id="B07101-e100420">The second, silver and watchet.</item>
            <pb facs="5" n="5"/>

          </list>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100450">All after the Roman form, adorned with much embossed and carved works, and each of them wrought with silver, and his several colour, they were mounted on carriages, the spring trees, pole and axletrees, the charioteers seat, and standers, wheels, with the fellies, spokes, and naves all wrought with silver, and their several colour.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100460">They were all drawn with four horses a-front after the magnificent Roman triumphs, their furniture, harness, headstall, bits, reins, and traces, Shaferon, cronet, petronel, and barb of rich cloth of silver, of several works, and colours answerable to the linings of the chariots. </p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100470">The charioteers in polony-coats of the same colour of the chariots, their caps feathers, and buskins answerable.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100480">The two out horses of every chariot led by two men in habits wrought with silver, and conformable to the colour of the other furniture, four footmen on either side of every chariot, in rich habits also wrought with silver answerable to the rest, every one carrying a flambeaux in his hand.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100490">Between every of these chariots four musicians in their robes and garlands, were mounted; riding two a breast, attended with torch-bearers.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100500">The habit of the masquers gave infinite splendour to this solemnity; which more aptly shall be expressed in his place.</p>
          <pb facs="6" n="6"/>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100510">This masque was presented in the banqueting-house. At white hall before the King and Queen's majesties and a great assembly of lords and ladies, and other persons of quality, whose aspect setting on the degrees prepared for that purpose gave a great grace to this spectacle, especially being all richly attired.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100520">At the lower end of the room opposite to the state was raised a stage with a descent of stairs in two branches landing into the room. This basement was painted in rustic work.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100530">The border of the front and sides that enclosed all the scene had first a ground of arbour-work intermixed with loose branches and leaves, and in this was two niches, and in them two great figures standing in easy postures in their natural colours, and much bigger than the life, the one attired after the Grecian manner held in one hand a sceptre, and in the other a scroll, and a picked antique crown on his head, his cuirass was of gold richly enchased, his robe blue and silver, his arms and thighs bare with buskings enriched with ornaments of gold, his brown locks long and curled, his beard thick but not long, and his face was of a grave and jovial aspect, this figure stood on a round pedestal feigned of white marble, enriched with several carvings; above this in a compartment of gold was written Minos. The figure on the other side was in a Roman habit, holding a table<pb facs="6" n="7"/> in one hand, and a pen in the other, and a white bend or diadem about his head, his robe was crimson and gold, his mantle yellow and silver, his buskins watchet trimmed with silver, his hair and beard long and white with a venerable aspect, standing likewise on a round pedestal answerable to the other. And in the compartment over him was written Numa. Above all this in a proportionate distance hung two great festons of fruits in colours which served for finishing to these sides. The upper part in manner of a large frieze was adorned with several compartments with draperies hanging down, and the ends tied up in knots, with trophies proper to feasts and triumphs, composed of masking vizards and torches. In one of the lesser compartments was figured a sharp sited eye, and in the other a golden-yoke, in the midst was a more great and rich compartment on the sides of which sat naked children in their natural colours with silver wings in action of sounding golden trumpets, and in this was figured a caduceus with an olive-branch all which are hieroglyphics of peace justice and law.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100540">A curtain being suddenly drawn up the scene was discovered representing a large street with sumptuous palaces lodges porticoes, and other noble pieces of architecture with pleasant trees and grounds, this going far from the eye opens itself into a spacious place adorned with public and private buildings seen afar off, representing the forum or piazza of peace. Over all was a<pb facs="7" n="8"/> clear sky with transparent clouds which enlightened all the scene.</p>
          <p xml:id="B07101-e100550">The spectators having entertained their eyes a while with the beauty and variety of this scene from one of the sides of the streets enters opinion, etc.</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
