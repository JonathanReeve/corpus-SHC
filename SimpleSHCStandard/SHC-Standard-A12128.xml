           <edition n="0.1">This early release includes some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words have been corrected, including obvious printers' errors,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word. Each word in the text has been identified as a distinct token with its own xml:id and assigned to a lemma, a part of speech, and a standard spelling.  Speech prefixes were mapped  to unique speaker ID's  as "who" attributes of <gi>sp</gi> elements. elements</edition>

        <p xml:id="A12128-e100390">The fame of your candour and innocent love to learning, especially to that musical part of humane knowledge poetry, and in particular to that which concerns the stage and scene (Your self as I hear, having lately written a tragedy) doth justly challenge from me this dedication. I had an early desire to congratulate your happy retirement, but no poem could tempt me with so fair a circumstance as this in the title, wherein I take some delight to think (Not without imitation of yourself) who have ingeniously fancied such elegant and apposite names, for your own compositions, as health's sickness, the unloveliness of love ▪ locks, etc.) how aptly I may present you at this time, with the bird in a cage. A comedy, which wanteth I must confess, much of that ornament, which the stage and action lent it, for it comprehending also another play or interlude, personated by ladies, I must refer to your imagination, the music, the songs, the dancing, and other varieties, which I know would have pleased you infinitely in the presentment. I was the rather inclined to make this oblation, that posterity might read you a patron to the Muses, and one that durst in such a critical age ▪ bind up the wounds which ignorance had printed upon wit and the professors: proceed (Inimitable Maecenas)<pb facs="3"/> and having such convenient leisure, and an Pegasus, I mean your prose (Which scorneth the road of common sense, and despiseth any style in his way) travel still in the pursuit of new discoveries, which you may publish if you please, in your next book of digressions. If you do not happen presently to convert the organs, you may in time confuse the steeple, and bring every parish to one bell. —</p>
        <p xml:id="A12128-e100400">This is all I have to say at this time, and my own occasions not permitting my personal attendance, I have entreated a gentleman to deliver this testimony of my service, many faults have escaped the press, which your judgement will no sooner find, than your mercy correct, by which you shall teach others a charity to your own volumes, though they be all errata. If you continue where you are, you will every day enlarge your fame, and beside the engagement of other poets to celebrate your Roman constancy, in particular oblige the tongue and pen of your devout honourer, —</p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
